  wiki_description : > 
      In Vegas, Ross and Rachel initially have no memory of getting married the previous night, 
      then must deal with the aftermath of their drunken escapade. Phoebe and Joey drive back 
      to New York in Phoebe's cab. She becomes angry when Joey sleeps most of the way rather 
      than playing his promised fun road trip games; he further unnerves Phoebe by picking up a 
      hitchhiker while she was napping. Back at home, Monica and Chandler ponder the idea of 
      marriage and decide to take their relationship forward a step by living together.
