  title: "The One After Vegas"
  wiki_description : > 
      In Vegas, Ross and Rachel initially have no memory of getting married the previous night, 
      then must deal with the aftermath of their drunken escapade. Phoebe and Joey drive back 
      to New York in Phoebe's cab. She becomes angry when Joey sleeps most of the way rather 
      than playing his promised fun road trip games; he further unnerves Phoebe by picking up a 
      hitchhiker while she was napping. Back at home, Monica and Chandler ponder the idea of 
      marriage and decide to take their relationship forward a step by living together.

  title: "The One Where Ross Hugs Rachel"
  wiki_description : > 
      Ross promises Rachel to get their Vegas marriage annulled, only to shock Phoebe by 
      confessing he cannot go through with it, unable to handle another failed marriage. Whilst he 
      and Phoebe consult other women to see whether they would date him after three divorces, one 
      of the women hypothesises that Ross is still in love with Rachel, to which Phoebe agrees. Ross 
      adamantly denies this and unsuccessfully attempts to secretly annul the marriage himself. 
      Monica and Chandler announce they are moving in together. Joey reacts badly to the news, 
      though Chandler reassures him their friendship will remain the same. Rachel mistakenly 
      believes all three will be living together until Monica explains Rachel has to move out. 
      Rachel then upsets Monica by her blasÃ© reaction, convinced Monica and Chandler will never go 
      through with it. When Monica assures her they will, Rachel becomes distraught and seeks comfort 
      from Ross, just as he is about to tell her the truth about their marriage.
