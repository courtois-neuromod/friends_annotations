  title: "The One After Ross Says Rachel"
  wiki_description : > 
      After Ross mistakenly says Rachel's name instead of Emily's at the altar, she runs off 
      and goes into hiding. Monica and Chandler, desperate to hook up again, are unable to find 
      a suitable place. Rachel debates whether she should confront Ross about her feelings. 
      Ross goes to the airport hoping Emily will show up so they can go on their honeymoon. He 
      runs into Rachel, who is on standby for a flight home. When it appears Emily is not coming, 
      Ross persuades Rachel to go with him instead. Emily shows up at the airport, but seeing 
      Rachel getting on the plane, she runs off again with Ross chasing after her. Rachel, waiting 
      for Ross to board the plane, ends up going to Greece alone.
