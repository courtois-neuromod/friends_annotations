  title: "The One with the Jellyfish"
  wiki_description : > 
      Ross breaks up with Bonnie in order to get back with Rachel, who prompts him to first read 
      her 18-page letter discussing their relationship and previous break-up. Ross falls asleep 
      while reading the letter, and unwittingly agrees to take full responsibility for their 
      break-up later on. Ross and Rachel then break up again after he refuses to take all the 
      blame for their previous problems (as have been stated in the letter) and insists they were 
      "on a break". Joey and Chandler come to Monica's rescue after she is stung by a jellyfish 
      - one of them has to pee on her leg to relieve the pain, as suggested by Joey who has learnt 
      it from watching the Discovery Channel. Phoebe goes to see her sister, Ursula, who reveals 
      that she already knows the truth about their birth mother.
