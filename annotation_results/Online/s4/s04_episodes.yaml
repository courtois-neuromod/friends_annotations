      effectively ruined when one of her false fingernails gets lost in one. Judy then reveals that

      her mother has never had faith in her, whips up delicious dishes at the last minute to prove 
      her mother wrong. Judy ultimately gets impressed and the two reconcile. Meanwhile, Chandler

      for hours. Rachel is furious when she sneaks into Joanna's office (having been under the 
      impression that Joanna has been listing names of employees that would get a Christmas bonus) 
      to find Chandler stuck there pantsless, since he has promised to end the relationship many 
      times but never does.
