  title: "The One with the Princess Leia Fantasy"
  wiki_description : > 
      Ross reveals a sexual fantasy to Rachel, which involves Princess Leia's gold bikini from 
      Return of the Jedi. Monica suffers from insomnia after breaking up with Richard. Chandler, 
      back together with Janice, wants Joey to bond with her, a seemingly impossible request. 
      To remedy the situation, Janice insists she and Joey spend a fun day together so they can 
      finally bond. Joey later admits to Chandler that he still cannot stand Janice, but says 
      that they both survived the day without incident, which is enough to satisfy Chandler.
