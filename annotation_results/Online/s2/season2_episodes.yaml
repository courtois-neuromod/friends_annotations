  title: "The One with Ross' New Girlfriend"
  wiki_description : > 
      At Rachel's birthday celebration, Chandler has accidentally revealed that Ross loves her. 
      Rachel goes to the airport to meet Ross and tell him she cares for him, unaware he is 
      returning with Julie, who he reconnected with in China and is now dating. Chandler then 
      feels guilty for advising Ross to get over Rachel. When Phoebe gives Joey and Chandler 
      haircuts, Monica wants one. Phoebe initially refuses, knowing Monica's obsessive 
      perfectionism, but finally relents. She misunderstands Monica's wishes and gives her a 
      haircut like Dudley Moore instead of Demi Moore. Joey takes Chandler to his tailor for a 
      new suit, but while measuring his inseam, the man touches Chandler inappropriately. He tells 
      Joey who naively believes that is the normal procedure. Ross' constant talk about Julie 
      upsets Rachel, who spends the night with her old lover, Paolo.
