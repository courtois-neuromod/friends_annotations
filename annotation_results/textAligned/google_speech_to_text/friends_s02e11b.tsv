I	359.6	359.7
couldn't	359.7	363.1
see	363.1	363.2
that.	363.2	363.4
Then	363.4	363.6
maybe	363.6	363.9

emphatic	379.4	379.9
about	379.9	380.1
this.	380.1	380.5
Course,	382.8	383.3
I	383.3	383.4

Jordan	386.4	386.5
Adelaide	386.5	387.3

want	393.1	393.2
me	393.2	393.4
to	393.4	393.5
marry	393.5	393.6
you,	393.6	393.9
No	395.1	395.5
