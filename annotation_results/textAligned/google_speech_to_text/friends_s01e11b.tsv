her.	353.2	353.5
Alright,	353.5	354.2
trust	354.2	354.5
me.	354.5	354.7
You	354.7	354.8
can't	354.8	355.2
talk	355.2	355.3
to	355.3	355.6
her.	355.6	355.7
Okay,	355.7	355.9
you	355.9	356.4
can	356.4	356.8
or	356.8	357.4
you	357.4	357.7
can	357.7	358.1
Okay,	359.1	359.6
that's	359.6	359.8
my	359.8	359.9
finger.	359.9	360.3
Okay.	360.3	361.6
All	373.8	374.1
right,	374.1	374.4

you	374.7	374.8
do	374.8	375.0
with	375.0	375.1
him?	375.1	375.2
Your	379.6	380.1
way	380.1	380.4
to	380.4	380.6
you.	380.6	381.0
How	381.0	382.1
do	382.1	382.1
you,	382.1	382.2
how	382.2	382.3

you	382.4	382.5
feel	382.5	382.7
a	382.7	384.4
little	384.4	384.6
woozy?	384.6	384.9
But	384.9	385.2
basically,	385.2	385.7
okay,	385.7	386.1
I	388.3	388.6
feel	388.6	389.0
good.	389.0	389.2
Who	391.1	391.4

I'm	393.3	393.7
Phoebe	393.7	394.3
buffay.	394.3	394.4
I've	394.4	396.6
been	396.6	396.7
taking	396.7	397.0
care	397.0	397.2
of	397.2	397.3
you	397.3	397.5
but	397.5	397.8
we	397.8	397.9
both	397.9	398.1
have	398.1	398.2
I	398.2	406.1
say	406.1	406.4
Well	409.2	409.8
thanks,	409.8	410.8
so	410.8	413.7
I	413.7	414.8
guess	414.8	415.1
I'll	415.1	415.2
see	415.2	415.9
you	415.9	416.0
around.	416.0	416.0
Let	417.4	417.8
that	417.8	417.9
sit	417.9	418.3
around.	418.3	420.4
Do	420.4	422.2
you	422.2	422.2
want	422.2	422.3
me	422.3	422.4
to	422.4	422.5
say	422.5	422.7
that	422.7	426.8
was	426.8	426.9
nice.	426.9	427.3
Admit	427.3	428.6
something	428.6	428.8
to	428.8	429.0
me.	429.0	429.1
I'll	430.6	431.0
call	431.0	431.3
you.	431.3	431.6
I	433.9	435.4
don't	435.4	435.6
think	435.6	435.7
you	435.7	435.9
mean	435.9	436.0
that.	436.0	436.1
So	440.4	440.8
typical	440.8	441.5
you	441.5	442.6
know	442.6	442.7
we	442.7	442.9
give	442.9	443.4
and	443.4	444.0
we	444.0	444.1
give	444.1	444.6
and	444.6	445.6
we	445.6	445.7
give	445.7	446.4
nothing	446.4	448.7
back	448.7	448.8
and	448.8	449.5
then	449.5	449.7
one	449.7	449.9
day	449.9	449.9
it's	449.9	450.3
just	450.3	450.4
you	450.4	450.6
know	450.6	450.7
you	450.7	450.8
wake	450.8	451.0
up	451.0	451.1
and	451.1	451.4
see	451.4	451.6

baby.	456.0	456.3
You	459.0	459.3
know	459.3	459.4
what?	459.4	459.7
We	460.5	460.9
thought	460.9	461.0
you	461.0	461.2
were	461.2	461.3
different	461.3	461.5
but	461.5	462.1
I	462.1	462.8
guess	462.8	463.1
it	463.1	463.2
was	463.2	463.3
just	463.3	463.4
the	463.4	463.6
coma.	463.6	464.0
Hey	473.9	474.2
kiddo,	474.2	474.7

drop	477.1	477.3
off	477.3	477.5
the	477.5	477.7
copies	477.7	478.2

a	481.2	481.3
goodbye	481.3	481.5
kiss	481.5	481.6
kiss.	481.6	482.0
Goodbye.	482.0	484.5
Ending	486.5	487.0

Lisbon?	487.3	487.7
No	487.7	488.2
no	488.2	488.3
just	488.3	488.6
knowing	488.6	489.0
you're	489.0	489.1
going	489.1	489.2
to	489.2	489.3
be.	489.3	489.4
There	489.4	489.5
is	489.5	489.6

You	497.8	498.2

that	503.3	503.3
effect.	503.3	503.5
Look	510.9	511.4

really	512.7	513.3
stupid,	513.3	514.0
really	514.0	514.5
stupid.	514.5	515.1
And	515.1	516.1
I	517.5	517.8
mean	517.8	518.2

will	522.2	522.3
never	522.3	522.4
happen	522.4	523.1
again.	523.1	523.8
Really,	525.1	525.6
really	525.6	526.0
stupid.	526.0	526.4
Are	530.7	531.0
we	531.0	531.1
okay	531.1	531.2
now?	531.2	531.4
No.	533.7	534.1
No.	535.4	535.8
All	540.3	540.7
the	540.7	540.9
Forbidden	540.9	541.2
Love	541.2	541.6
of	541.6	541.7
a	541.7	541.8
man	541.8	542.0
in	542.0	542.3
his	542.3	542.4
door.	542.4	543.0
I	545.2	545.5
told	545.5	546.7
her	546.7	546.7
off	546.7	547.0
and	547.0	547.1
not	547.1	547.3
just	547.3	547.5
about	547.5	547.7
the	547.7	547.8
kiss	547.8	548.1
about	548.1	548.2
everything	548.2	548.8
you	548.8	549.0
couldn't	549.0	549.4
do	549.4	549.5
know.	549.5	549.8
He	549.8	550.1
said,	550.1	550.3
when	550.3	550.7
are	550.7	550.8
you	550.8	550.8
going	550.8	551.0
to	551.0	551.0
grow	551.0	551.3
up	551.3	551.4
and	551.4	551.6
start	551.6	551.8
being	551.8	552.1
a	552.1	552.2
mom?	552.2	552.6
And	552.6	553.8
she	553.8	554.1
came	554.1	554.3
back	554.3	554.5
with?	554.5	554.8
The	554.8	555.2
question	555.2	555.6
is,	555.6	555.7
when	555.7	556.3
are	556.3	556.4
you	556.4	556.5
going	556.5	556.7
to	556.7	556.8
grow	556.8	557.0
up	557.0	557.1
and	557.1	557.3
realize	557.3	557.4
I	557.4	557.8
have	557.8	558.1
a	558.1	558.2
bomb?	558.2	558.6
It	561.4	561.7
would	561.7	561.9
have	561.9	562.0
been.	562.0	562.0
Are	562.0	562.2
you	562.2	562.3
sure	562.3	562.5
she	562.5	562.6
didn't	562.6	562.9
say	562.9	563.0
when	563.0	563.5
you	563.5	563.6
going	563.6	563.8
to	563.8	563.8
grow	563.8	564.0
up	564.0	564.1
and	564.1	564.4
realize	564.4	564.4
I	564.4	565.1
am	565.1	565.3
your	565.3	566.6
mom?	566.6	567.0
That	570.8	571.2
makes	571.2	571.4
more	571.4	571.6
sense.	571.6	571.9
So	571.9	575.6
what's	575.6	575.8
going	575.8	576.0
on?	576.0	576.1
I	582.4	582.7
don't	582.7	582.8
hear	582.8	583.0
anything.	583.0	583.2
I	583.2	593.0
don't	593.0	594.5
have	594.5	594.6
to	594.6	594.9
come	594.9	595.0
right	595.0	595.2
now.	595.2	595.3
Your	599.7	600.1
cake,	600.1	600.4
you	600.4	600.5
know?	600.5	600.6
Be	602.6	603.4
good.	603.4	603.8
This	608.2	608.6
is	608.6	608.7
dang.	608.7	609.0
Hey.	615.7	616.1
You	619.0	619.4
may	619.4	619.5
not	619.5	619.7
know	619.7	621.9
why	621.9	622.3
not.	622.3	622.7
So	622.7	625.6
I	625.6	625.7
told	625.7	625.9
her	625.9	626.1
Well,	631.5	632.8
how	632.8	633.8
do	633.8	633.9
you	633.9	633.9
feel	633.9	634.3
pretty	634.3	634.6
good?	634.6	634.9
I	634.9	637.7
told	637.7	637.9
her.	637.9	638.0
Well	639.0	639.4
she	639.4	640.6
so	640.6	641.5
maybe	641.5	641.9
it	641.9	641.9
wasn't	641.9	642.1
such	642.1	642.3
a	642.3	642.5
bad	642.5	642.6
idea,	642.6	642.7
it'll	642.7	643.3
be	643.3	643.4
kissing	643.4	643.8
your	643.8	643.9
mom	643.9	644.2
but	644.2	645.8
we	645.8	646.0
don't	646.0	646.2
have	646.2	646.3
to	646.3	646.4
go	646.4	646.5
down	646.5	646.8
that	646.8	647.0
road.	647.0	647.1
Okay.	653.6	653.9
And	656.8	657.2
I	657.2	657.3
want	657.3	657.5
your	657.5	657.6

Penny.	659.4	660.2
Okay.	660.2	661.2
Right,	661.2	670.8
right.	670.8	671.0
But	671.0	671.3
but	671.3	671.5
in	671.5	671.6
this	671.6	671.7
case,	671.7	671.9
she	671.9	672.1
doesn't	672.1	672.4
What's	674.3	674.6
a	674.6	674.7
nipple?	674.7	675.1
Do	675.1	675.7
you	675.7	675.8
usually	675.8	676.0
find	676.0	676.2
them	676.2	676.5
on	676.5	676.6
the	676.6	676.7
heating	676.7	677.0
Beast?	677.0	677.5
The	683.5	683.7

his	684.0	684.6
huge	684.6	685.0
dropping	685.0	685.5
tens.	685.5	686.0
you	687.8	688.5
don't	688.5	688.6
want	688.6	688.7
to	688.7	688.7
be	688.7	688.8
around	688.8	688.9
when	688.9	689.1
he	689.1	689.2
starts	689.2	689.5
writing	689.5	689.7
without	689.7	690.1
care.	697.9	698.4
