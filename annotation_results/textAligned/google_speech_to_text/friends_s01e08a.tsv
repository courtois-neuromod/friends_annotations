I	462.6	462.9
miss	462.9	463.2
her.	463.2	463.4
I	473.0	474.9
don't	474.9	475.1
believe	475.1	475.4
any	475.4	475.6
of	475.6	475.7
that.	475.7	475.8
I	475.8	476.0
think	476.0	476.1

This	500.8	503.0
is	503.0	503.2
crazy.	503.2	503.9
It's	503.9	504.1
going	504.1	504.3
into	504.3	504.5
the	504.5	504.6
ground.	504.6	505.2
We	505.2	505.3
should	505.3	505.5
just	505.5	505.7
get	505.7	505.9
the	505.9	506.0
most	506.0	506.2
basic	506.2	506.7
thing	506.7	507.2
that	507.2	511.2
we	511.2	514.3
can't	514.3	514.6
bury	514.6	514.8
Nana	514.8	515.1
and	515.1	515.2
a	515.2	515.2
dresser	515.2	515.5
from	515.5	515.7
Ikea.	515.7	516.0
Why	518.6	519.0
your	519.0	519.3
mother	519.3	519.5
buys	519.5	520.0
all	520.0	520.1
my	520.1	520.3
clothes?	520.3	520.8
I	520.8	520.9
hate	520.9	521.2
to	521.2	521.4
shop.	521.4	521.8
I	521.8	521.9
hate	521.9	522.3
it.	522.3	522.4
Just	522.4	524.6
might	524.6	524.9
be	524.9	525.0
more	525.0	525.2
about	525.2	525.5
the	525.5	525.6
fact	525.6	526.0
that	526.0	526.0
once	526.0	527.3
you	527.3	527.4
make	527.4	527.4
the	527.4	527.6
decision	527.6	527.8
it's	527.8	528.4
like	528.4	528.7
acknowledging	528.7	528.9
has	528.9	529.6
actually	529.6	530.0
gone.	530.0	530.1
No,	532.1	532.5
I	532.5	532.7
really	532.7	532.9
hate	532.9	533.3
to	533.3	533.3
shop.	533.3	533.8
I	540.8	541.1
thought	541.1	541.4
it	541.4	541.4
was	541.4	541.5
going	541.5	541.6
to	541.6	541.7
be	541.7	541.8
closed.	541.8	542.2
Casket.	542.2	542.5
Look	542.5	544.7

can	552.1	552.3
get	552.3	552.4
in	552.4	552.6
there.	552.6	552.6
I	552.6	554.2
don't	554.2	554.3
see	554.3	554.5
why	554.5	554.7
not.	554.7	554.8
Where's	574.8	575.3
my	575.3	575.4
retainer?	575.4	576.1
I	580.2	585.8
was	585.8	586.0
just	586.0	586.3
thinking	586.3	586.4
when	586.4	587.9
my	587.9	588.1
time	588.1	588.5
comes	588.5	588.7
listen	588.7	590.2
to	590.2	590.5
me.	590.5	590.6
When	592.5	592.9
my	592.9	593.1
time	593.1	593.4
comes,	593.4	593.6
I	593.6	595.0
want	595.0	595.2
to	595.2	595.3
be	595.3	595.4
buried	595.4	595.6
at	595.6	595.9
Sea.	595.9	596.2
I	600.8	601.2
want	601.2	601.5
to	601.5	601.6
be	601.6	601.7
buried	601.7	601.8
at	601.8	602.1
Sea.	602.1	602.5
It	602.5	602.8
looks	602.8	602.9
like	602.9	603.3
fun.	603.3	603.5
Define	606.1	607.1
bun.	607.1	607.7
Come	607.7	608.2
on,	608.2	608.5
you'll	608.5	608.7
make	608.7	608.9
a	608.9	609.0
day	609.0	609.2
of	609.2	609.4
it.	609.4	609.5
You'll	609.5	610.2
get	610.2	610.3
a	610.3	610.4
boat	610.4	610.9

A	611.2	611.3

Everyone	618.2	619.2
says,	619.2	619.4
Jack	619.4	619.9
Geller.	619.9	620.2
So	620.2	620.6
predictable,	620.6	621.4
maybe	621.4	622.4
after	622.4	622.8
I'm	622.8	622.9
gone.	622.9	623.1
They'll	623.1	623.5

ditzy.	624.6	625.0
Huh.	625.0	626.1
That's	630.1	630.8
probably	630.8	631.4
what	631.4	631.6
they'll	631.6	631.8
say.	631.8	632.0
I'd	632.0	633.1
like	633.1	633.2
that.	633.2	633.6
Hey,	646.1	646.5

because	672.6	672.8
you	672.8	673.0
