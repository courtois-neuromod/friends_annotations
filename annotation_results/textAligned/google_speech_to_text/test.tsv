go	38.2	38.4
through	38.4	38.6
what	38.6	38.7
I	38.7	38.9
went	38.9	39.0
through	39.0	39.2
with	39.2	39.4
Carl.	39.4	39.9
Relax.	42.5	43.2
This	43.2	43.2
is	43.2	43.4
not	43.4	43.6
even	43.6	43.7
a	43.7	43.9
date,	43.9	44.0
it	44.0	44.6
is	44.6	44.6
not.	44.6	45.0
It's	45.0	45.1
just	45.1	45.2
two	45.2	45.5
people	45.5	45.7
going	45.7	45.9
out	45.9	46.1
to	46.1	46.2
dinner	46.2	46.3
and	46.3	46.7
not	46.7	47.3
having	47.3	47.6
sex.	47.6	47.7
High	54.7	55.1
School	55.1	55.3
standing	55.3	55.7
in	55.7	55.8
the	55.8	55.9
middle	55.9	56.0
of	56.0	56.1
the	56.1	56.1
cafeteria.	56.1	56.4
And	56.4	57.0
I	57.0	57.1
realize	57.1	57.8
I	57.8	57.9
am	57.9	58.1
totally	58.1	58.5
naked.	58.5	60.0
Then	62.6	63.2
I	63.2	63.3
looked	63.3	63.7
down	63.7	63.7
and	63.7	64.0
I	64.0	64.2
realized	64.2	64.7
there	64.7	64.9
was	64.9	65.0
a	65.0	65.1
phone.	65.1	65.6
There.	66.5	67.9
Instead	71.2	71.9
of	71.9	72.0
all	72.0	75.4
of	75.4	75.5
a	75.5	75.6
sudden,	75.6	76.0
the	76.0	76.2
phone	76.2	76.6
starts	76.6	78.0
to	78.0	78.1
ring	78.1	78.4
looking	78.4	83.6
at	83.6	83.7
you	83.7	83.8
before.	83.8	84.0
Finally,	86.5	87.1
I	87.1	87.2
figured	87.2	87.4
I'd	87.4	87.9
better	87.9	88.0
answer	88.0	88.3
it.	88.3	88.6
And	90.4	90.8
it	90.8	90.9
turns	90.9	91.2
out	91.2	91.3
it's	91.3	91.6
my	91.6	91.8
mother.	91.8	92.2
which	94.0	94.3
is	94.3	94.5
very,	94.5	94.7
very	94.7	95.0
weird	95.0	95.7
because	95.7	95.9
She	96.9	97.4
never	97.4	97.6
called.	97.6	98.0
This	108.1	108.5
guy	108.5	108.7
says	108.7	108.9
hello.	108.9	109.2
I	109.2	109.3
want	109.3	109.5

Oh	131.2	131.8
no,	131.8	133.7
don't	133.7	134.3
stop.	134.3	134.9
Cleansing	134.9	135.6
my	135.6	135.8
aura.	135.8	136.3
Gmarket.	139.2	141.7
You	151.0	151.2
never	151.2	151.4
knew	151.4	151.6
she	151.6	151.8
was	151.8	151.9
a	151.9	152.0
lesbian.	152.0	152.1
Know	156.7	157.3
what	157.3	159.6
is	159.6	159.8
everyone	159.8	160.4
keep	160.4	160.5
fixating	160.5	161.4
on	161.4	161.5
that?	161.5	161.9
How	163.5	164.8
should	164.8	165.1
I	165.1	165.2
know?	165.2	165.3
Sometimes	168.4	168.9
I	168.9	169.0
wish	169.0	169.2
I	169.2	169.3
was	169.3	169.5
a	169.5	169.6
lesbian.	169.6	169.8
Did	172.7	173.1
I	173.1	173.2
say	173.2	173.4
that	173.4	173.6
out	173.6	173.6
loud?	173.6	173.8
I	177.3	177.6
told	177.6	178.0
Mom	178.0	178.2
and	178.2	178.3
Dad	178.3	178.4
last	178.4	178.9
night,	178.9	179.0
they	179.0	179.4
seemed	179.4	179.9

take	180.0	180.2
it	180.2	180.4
pretty	180.4	180.6
well.	180.6	180.8
So	180.8	182.6

Bridesmaids?	263.5	264.2
Well,	266.5	267.7
it	267.7	268.8
started	268.8	269.0
about	269.0	269.3
a	269.3	269.5
half	269.5	269.7
hour	269.7	269.9
before	269.9	270.1
the	270.1	270.3
wedding.	270.3	270.6
I	270.6	271.7
was	271.7	271.8
in	271.8	272.0
this	272.0	272.0
room	272.0	272.2
where	272.2	272.5
we	272.5	272.6

keeping	272.7	272.9
all	272.9	273.1
the	273.1	273.2
presents,	273.2	273.8
and	273.8	274.5
I	274.5	274.7
was	274.7	274.8
looking	274.8	274.9
at	274.9	275.2
this	275.2	275.3
crazy,	275.3	275.6
but	275.6	275.9
it's	275.9	277.0
really	277.0	277.3
the	277.3	278.8
most	278.8	279.2
rated	279.2	279.5
food.	279.5	279.7
I	285.7	286.0
realize	286.0	286.3
that	286.3	286.4
I	286.4	286.5
was	286.5	286.6
more	286.6	287.0
turned	287.0	287.3
on	287.3	287.3
by	287.3	287.6
this	287.6	287.7
really	287.7	288.0
both	288.0	288.3
and	288.3	288.5
Byberry	288.5	288.7
and	288.7	290.0
I	290.0	290.2
got	290.2	290.3
really	290.3	290.5
freaked	290.5	291.0
out	291.0	291.1
and	291.1	291.8
that's	291.8	292.0
when	292.0	292.1
it	292.1	292.2
hit	292.2	292.3
me.	292.3	292.5
How	292.5	293.1

Looks	293.4	293.7
like	293.7	293.8
mr.	293.8	294.1
Potato	294.1	294.3
Head.	294.3	294.5
So	309.4	309.8
anyway,	309.8	310.3
I	310.3	310.4
just	310.4	310.6
didn't	310.6	310.9
know	310.9	311.0
where	311.0	311.1
to	311.1	311.2
go	311.2	311.4
and	311.4	311.7
I	311.7	311.8
know	311.8	311.9
that	311.9	312.0
you	312.0	312.2
and	312.2	312.3
I	312.3	312.4
have	312.4	312.6
kind	312.6	312.7
of	312.7	312.9
drifted	312.9	313.2
apart	313.2	313.3
but	313.3	314.0
you're	314.0	314.8
the	314.8	314.9
only	314.9	315.0
person	315.0	315.3
I	315.3	315.6
knew	315.6	315.7
who	315.7	315.8
lived	315.8	316.0
here	316.0	316.3
in	316.3	316.3
this	316.3	316.4
city	316.4	316.7
who	316.7	317.5
wasn't	317.5	317.9
invited	317.9	318.4
to	318.4	318.5
the	318.5	318.5
wedding.	318.5	318.6
She's	335.9	341.2
really	341.2	341.5
not	341.5	341.6
happy	341.6	341.8
about	341.8	341.9
it.	341.9	342.2
Tuna	344.6	345.0
salad,	345.0	345.6
have	345.6	349.5
whatever	349.5	350.0
Christine	350.0	350.8

having.	350.9	351.0
I	353.7	355.5
can't	355.5	355.8
marry	355.8	356.0
him.	356.0	356.2
I'm	356.2	357.6
sorry,	357.6	358.0
I	358.0	359.3
just	359.3	359.5
don't	359.5	359.9
love	359.9	360.2
him.	360.2	360.6
Well,	360.6	362.8
it	362.8	362.9
matters	362.9	363.3
to	363.3	363.5
me.	363.5	363.6
I	366.3	368.9
let	368.9	369.3
go	369.3	369.5
of	369.5	369.6
my	369.6	369.9
hair.	369.9	370.2
My	370.2	370.5
head	370.5	370.9
will	370.9	371.2
follow.	371.2	371.6
She	374.7	375.1
should	375.1	375.5
not	375.5	375.9
be	375.9	376.1
wearing	376.1	376.4
those	376.4	376.6
pants.	376.6	377.1
I	377.1	378.5
say	378.5	378.8
push	378.8	379.1
it	379.1	379.3
down	379.3	379.4
the	379.4	379.6
stairs.	379.6	379.9
If	391.9	392.3
everyone	392.3	392.7
is	392.7	392.8
always	392.8	393.0
told	393.0	393.4

where	414.6	414.8
you'd	414.8	414.9
have	414.9	415.1
trouble.	415.1	415.3
Well,	422.7	423.0
maybe	423.0	423.2

my	432.6	433.0
decision.	433.0	433.2
Well,	435.3	435.7
maybe	435.7	436.0
I	436.0	436.2
don't	436.2	436.4
need	436.4	436.6
your	436.6	436.8
