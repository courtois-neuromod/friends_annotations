He's	419.9	420.1

and	420.5	420.7
she's	420.7	420.8
going	420.8	421.0
to	421.0	421.0
tell	421.0	421.3
him	421.3	421.4
what	421.4	421.5
I	421.5	421.6

You	421.6	422.6

I	426.6	426.9
can't	426.9	427.2
tell	427.2	427.4

that	427.5	427.6
it's	427.6	427.8
like	427.8	428.0
the	428.0	428.0
most	428.0	428.2
awful,	428.2	428.7
horrible	428.7	429.1
thing	429.1	429.4
I've	429.4	429.5
ever	429.5	429.6
done	429.6	429.7
in	429.7	430.0
my	430.0	430.0
whole	430.0	430.2
life.	430.2	430.6
Do	434.7	435.1
you	435.1	435.2
know	435.2	435.2
what	435.2	435.5
Goodfellas	435.5	436.2

Michael	436.8	437.0
trainer	437.0	437.3
gets	437.3	437.5
home?	437.5	437.6
Because	437.6	437.8
it'll	437.8	438.2
be	438.2	438.3
more	438.3	438.5
fun	438.5	438.6
that	438.6	438.8
way.	438.8	438.9
Okay	442.0	442.3
with	442.3	442.4
that	442.4	442.5
was	442.5	443.3
like	443.3	443.4
four	443.4	443.7
years	443.7	443.8
ago.	443.8	444.1
Okay,	444.1	445.0
Ginger.	445.0	445.4
And	445.4	445.6
I'd	445.6	445.7
gone	445.7	446.0
out	446.0	446.0
a	446.0	446.2
few	446.2	446.2
times	446.2	446.5
and	446.5	446.9
then	446.9	447.1
just	447.1	447.5
one	447.5	447.8
weekend,	447.8	448.2
we	448.2	448.3
went	448.3	448.5
up	448.5	448.6
to	448.6	448.7
her	448.7	448.9
dad's	448.9	449.2
cabin,	449.2	449.5
just	449.5	449.9
me	449.9	450.2
and	450.2	450.3
her,	450.3	450.5
and	450.5	450.9
her	450.9	451.5
annoying	451.5	452.0
little	452.0	452.1
dog	452.1	452.5
Pepper.	452.5	452.9
But	452.9	454.3
that	454.3	454.6
night	454.6	454.8
I	454.8	454.9
cooked	454.9	455.2
this	455.2	455.3
really	455.3	455.8
romantic	455.8	456.1
dinner	456.1	456.9
after	456.9	462.4
dinner.	462.4	462.7
I	462.7	466.5
woke	466.5	466.8
up	466.8	466.9
in	466.9	467.1
the	467.1	467.2
middle	467.2	467.3
of	467.3	467.4
the	467.4	467.5
night	467.5	467.8
and	467.8	467.9
I	467.9	468.0
saw	468.0	468.2
that	468.2	468.4
the	468.4	468.5
fire	468.5	468.9
was	468.9	469.1
dying	469.1	469.5
out,	469.5	469.7
so	469.7	470.0
I	470.0	470.9
picked	470.9	471.2
up	471.2	471.3
a	471.3	471.4
log	471.4	471.8
and	471.8	471.9
threw	471.9	472.1
it	472.1	472.2
on.	472.2	472.3
Or	475.2	475.5
at	475.5	475.6
least	475.6	475.7
what	475.7	475.9
I	475.9	476.0
thought	476.0	476.3
was	476.3	476.4
a	476.4	476.5
log.	476.5	476.8
I	480.7	481.0
wish.	481.0	481.5

guess,	484.7	484.9
another	484.9	485.2
thing	485.2	485.4
I	485.4	485.6
probably	485.6	486.5
