OK,	136.8	137.0
Google	137.0	137.4
to	137.4	139.2
be	139.2	139.2
that	139.2	139.8
guy.	139.8	140.1
That	140.1	141.4

not	142.8	142.9
going	142.9	143.2
to	143.2	143.2
be	143.2	143.3
my	143.3	143.6
thing.	143.6	143.8
So	146.3	147.5
we	147.5	147.7
just	147.7	147.8
stay	147.8	148.2
married	148.2	148.8
forever.	148.8	149.0
I	151.2	151.6
haven't	151.6	153.6
worked	153.6	154.2
it	154.2	154.3
all	154.3	154.3
out	154.3	154.6
yet,	154.6	155.0
but	155.0	155.7
I	155.7	156.0
know	156.0	156.6
it's	156.6	157.3
a	157.3	157.7
bit	157.7	157.9
crazy.	157.9	158.2
I	165.3	165.6
mean	165.6	165.8
you	165.8	166.0
feel	166.0	166.2
some	166.2	166.9
form	166.9	167.7
out	167.7	168.1
once	168.1	168.4
in	168.4	168.5
awhile	168.5	168.6
instead	168.6	169.1
of	169.1	169.5
checking	169.5	170.0
the	170.0	170.2
box	170.2	170.6
that	170.6	170.7
says,	170.7	170.8
miss	170.8	171.4
you	171.4	171.5
check	171.5	171.8
the	171.8	172.0
box	172.0	172.3
that	172.3	172.4
says	172.4	172.5
mrs.	172.5	173.3
It's	173.3	173.6
right	173.6	174.2
next	174.2	174.8
to	174.8	175.1
it.	175.1	175.4
Oh	178.4	178.7
okay	178.7	179.9
I'm	179.9	180.1
sorry	180.1	180.4
you're	180.4	180.7
right.	180.7	180.8
You	180.8	181.0
know	181.0	181.1
that	181.1	181.2
we	181.2	181.4
absolutely	181.4	181.7
can't	181.7	182.3
stay	182.3	182.9
married	182.9	183.1
because	183.1	183.4
I	183.4	183.6
was	183.6	183.9
under	183.9	184.1
the	184.1	184.2
impression	184.2	184.3
that	184.3	184.7
the	184.7	184.9
boxes	184.9	185.2
were	185.2	185.4
far	185.4	185.6
away	185.6	185.8
from	185.8	186.7
you.	186.7	187.0
Please	192.8	195.6
take	195.6	195.9
a	195.9	196.0
moment	196.0	196.0
here	196.0	196.6
and	196.6	197.4
think	197.4	198.0
about	198.0	198.2
what	198.2	198.5
you're	198.5	198.6
asking	198.6	199.1
of	199.1	199.1
Me,	199.1	199.3
Okay?	199.3	199.6
Asking	199.6	201.9
you	201.9	202.4
to	202.4	202.8
do	202.8	203.1
me	203.1	203.4
a	203.4	203.6
favor.	203.6	203.8
You	207.4	207.8
are	207.8	208.1
asking	208.1	208.9
me	208.9	209.1
to	209.1	209.5
be	209.5	209.9
your	209.9	210.1
and	211.2	211.8
as	211.8	212.3
my	212.3	212.5
wife,	212.5	213.2
I	213.2	213.4
think	213.4	213.6
you	213.6	214.2
should	214.2	214.3
grant	214.3	214.8
me	214.8	215.0
this	215.0	215.2
favor.	215.2	215.5
we	219.3	219.7
did	219.7	220.0
make	220.0	220.2
vows	220.2	220.8
I	223.4	225.5
can't	225.5	226.1
take	226.1	226.2
me	226.2	226.3
really	226.3	226.7
hard	226.7	226.9
on	226.9	227.0
a	227.0	227.1
plane.	227.1	227.5
Feeling	234.0	235.7
bad.	235.7	235.8
It	248.0	249.5
doesn't	249.5	249.8
mean	249.8	249.9
you	249.9	250.1
think	250.1	250.2
of	250.2	250.4
it.	250.4	250.6
A	256.4	256.7
hitchhiker,	256.7	257.5
he	257.5	258.3
could	258.3	258.5
be	258.5	258.6
a	258.6	258.7
ripped,	258.7	259.6
he	259.6	259.9
could	259.9	260.0
be	260.0	260.2
a	260.2	260.2
rapist	260.2	260.7
or	260.7	260.9
killer	260.9	261.0
or	261.0	261.5
something	261.5	261.9
before	261.9	264.4
you	264.4	264.5
go	264.5	264.5
to	264.5	264.6
sleep.	264.6	268.6
And	268.6	269.5
you,	269.5	269.6
are	269.6	269.9
you	269.9	270.1
a	270.1	270.1
rapist	270.1	270.7
Yeah,	273.9	274.3
you	274.3	274.6
know	274.6	274.7
the	274.7	274.8
license	274.8	275.7
plate	275.7	275.9
game,	275.9	276.1
I	276.1	276.4
want	276.4	276.8
the	276.8	276.9
license	276.9	277.4
plate	277.4	277.6
game.	277.6	277.8
Hey	289.3	289.8
listen,	289.8	290.9
I	290.9	291.6
know	291.6	291.8
you	291.8	291.8
want	291.8	292.0
to	292.0	292.1
talk	292.1	292.5
to	292.5	292.6
me	292.6	292.8
but	292.8	293.4
I	293.4	293.5
have	293.5	293.7
an	293.7	293.7
idea	293.7	293.8
that	293.8	294.7
may	294.7	295.1
make	295.1	295.3
you	295.3	295.7
want	295.7	296.0
to	296.0	296.0
stay	296.0	296.2
married	296.2	296.3
or	296.3	297.5
we	297.5	298.9
register	298.9	299.7
and	299.7	300.9
you	300.9	301.2
get	301.2	301.7
to	301.7	301.8
keep	301.8	301.8
all	301.8	302.2
the	302.2	302.7
presents.	302.7	303.3
I	310.1	310.1
thought	310.1	310.8
a	310.8	310.9
lot	310.9	311.0
about	311.0	311.2
how	311.2	311.5
to	311.5	311.5
tell	311.5	311.9
you	311.9	312.0
this	312.0	312.1
and	312.1	312.4
actually	312.4	313.3
came	313.3	313.5
up	313.5	313.5
with	313.5	313.7
analogy	313.7	314.2
about	314.2	314.4
a	314.4	314.5
little	314.5	314.6
goldfish	314.6	315.3
and	315.3	316.0
a	316.0	316.0
pond	316.0	316.4
freezes	316.4	316.7
over	316.7	316.9
in	316.9	317.2
the	317.2	317.3
winter.	317.3	317.6
But	317.6	317.7
then	317.7	318.0
I	318.0	318.1
realize	318.1	318.5
I	318.5	318.6
was	318.6	318.7
more	318.7	319.0
of	319.0	319.0
a	319.0	319.1
story	319.1	319.3
about	319.3	319.4
what	319.4	319.6
to	319.6	319.8
do	319.8	319.9
with	319.9	320.0
people	320.0	320.3
pick	320.3	320.5
on	320.5	320.6
you.	320.6	320.9
So	320.9	321.5
I'm	321.5	321.6
actually	321.6	321.7
say	321.7	321.9
that	321.9	322.1
the	322.1	327.5
bottom	327.5	327.7
line	327.7	328.1
is	328.1	329.2
we	329.2	329.5
cannot	329.5	329.9
stay	329.9	330.4
married.	330.4	331.2
I	333.0	333.3
don't	333.3	333.5
know	333.5	333.6
if	333.6	333.7
it's	333.7	333.9
true	333.9	334.0
but	334.0	334.4
it	334.4	334.7
is	334.7	335.2
a	335.2	337.0
difference	337.0	341.1
of	341.1	341.6
opinion.	341.6	341.9
And	345.0	345.4
when	345.4	345.7
that	345.7	345.7
happens	345.7	346.0
in	346.0	346.6
a	346.6	346.6
marriage,	346.6	346.8
all	359.8	360.1
right.	360.1	360.3
All	360.3	361.3
