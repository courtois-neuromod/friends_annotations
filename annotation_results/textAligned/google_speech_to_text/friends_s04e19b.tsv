We	405.0	405.6
took	405.6	405.9
our	405.9	406.3
apartment	406.3	406.9
back.	406.9	407.5
I	411.6	412.0

do	412.7	412.9
with	412.9	413.0
it.	413.0	413.1
Okay,	416.4	417.2
it	417.2	417.5
was	417.5	417.6
my	417.6	418.0

about	419.2	419.4
it.	419.4	419.7
We	424.4	424.8
are	424.8	424.9
switching	424.9	425.2
back	425.2	425.6
right	425.6	426.5
now	426.5	426.7
because	426.7	431.1
you	431.1	431.2
both	431.2	431.4
have	431.4	431.6
jobs	431.6	431.8

there's	432.1	434.3
nothing	434.3	434.6
you	434.6	434.7
can	434.7	434.8
do	434.8	435.0
to	435.0	435.1

want	444.1	444.2
to	444.2	444.3
move	444.3	444.5
again.	444.5	445.2
I	448.4	448.6
don't	448.6	448.8
care	448.8	449.2
if	449.2	449.3
this	449.3	449.4
is	449.4	449.6
our	449.6	449.8
apartment	449.8	450.1
and	450.1	450.7
they	450.7	450.8
still	450.8	451.2
do.	451.2	451.5
Or	453.6	454.0
we	454.0	454.9
won	454.9	455.1
that	455.1	455.2
apartment	455.2	455.6
for	455.6	455.7
rent.	455.7	455.9
Square	455.9	456.3
twice.	456.3	456.9
And	456.9	457.1
I	457.1	457.2
am	457.2	457.3
getting	457.3	457.4
it	457.4	457.6
back	457.6	457.7
right	457.7	458.1
now,	458.1	458.4
right	458.4	459.4
now.	459.4	459.5
Bright.	462.3	462.8
I	464.5	464.8
figured	464.8	465.2
you	465.2	465.2
might	465.2	465.3
respond	465.3	465.9
this	465.9	466.1
way.	466.1	466.3
So	467.6	468.0
we	468.0	468.1
have	468.1	468.3
a	468.3	468.3
backup	468.3	468.7

No	468.9	470.4
more	470.4	470.4
offers.	470.4	470.9
You	470.9	471.0
can't	471.0	471.1
offer	471.1	471.3
anything	471.3	471.8
to	471.8	472.1
us.	472.1	472.4
Let	472.4	473.0

Goodman.	489.2	489.6
Men	496.9	497.5
are	497.5	497.6
such	497.6	498.0
idiots.	498.0	498.2
Can	498.2	500.1
