same	422.6	422.9
time	422.9	422.9
I'm	422.9	423.3
thinking,	423.3	423.4
well,	423.4	423.9
I'm	423.9	424.0
going	424.0	424.1
to	424.1	424.2
be	424.2	424.3
right	424.3	424.6
back	424.6	424.8
there	424.8	425.1
and	425.1	425.3
a	425.3	425.3
couple	425.3	425.4
of	425.4	425.7
days	425.7	425.9
dropping	425.9	426.4
her	426.4	426.4
off.	426.4	426.8
So	426.8	427.6
what	427.6	427.8
are	427.8	427.8
you	427.8	427.9
going	427.9	428.0
to	428.0	428.0
do	428.0	428.2
nothing?	428.2	428.8
There's	428.8	429.1
nothing	429.1	429.3
to	429.3	429.7
do	429.7	430.0
and	430.0	430.1
she	430.1	430.4
lives	430.4	430.7
there.	430.7	430.7
I	430.7	431.0
live	431.0	431.3
here.	431.3	431.6
I	431.6	431.8
mean,	431.8	431.9
she	431.9	432.1
said	432.1	432.2
she'd	432.2	432.5
have	432.5	432.6
to	432.6	432.8
move	432.8	433.6
here.	433.6	433.7
She	433.7	434.9
should	434.9	435.2
move	435.2	435.5
here.	435.5	436.1
What?	437.3	437.8
I	437.8	438.9
can	438.9	439.0
ask	439.0	439.2
you	439.2	439.2
to	439.2	439.3
live	439.3	439.6
with	439.6	439.7
me.	439.7	439.8
Are	439.8	440.4
you	440.4	440.5
serious?	440.5	440.8
Why	440.8	441.4
not	441.4	441.7
why	441.7	442.5
not?	442.5	442.6
Because	442.6	443.3

a	446.9	447.0
longer	447.0	447.2
relationship	447.2	447.4

Well,	449.8	450.9
I'm	450.9	451.1

her.	451.3	451.5
It's	451.5	451.8
it's	451.8	452.0
it's	452.0	452.1

Okay.	534.2	534.6
But	534.6	535.0
we	535.0	535.1
can't	535.1	535.3
live	535.3	535.5
in	535.5	535.6
a	535.6	535.7
small	535.7	535.9

after	536.0	536.5
we've	536.5	536.6
lived	536.6	536.8

read	537.8	538.0
Flowers	538.0	538.4

read	541.7	541.9
Sports	541.9	542.2

didn't	545.7	545.9
read	545.9	546.1
yours	546.1	546.5

go	548.0	548.1
to	548.1	548.2
the	548.2	548.2

Only	548.6	549.7
way	549.7	550.0
I	550.0	550.2
will	550.2	550.4
even	550.4	550.6
consider	550.6	550.7
this	550.7	551.3
as	551.3	551.8
if	551.8	552.0
they	552.0	552.1
offer	552.1	552.4
a	552.4	552.4
lot	552.4	552.8
more	552.8	553.0
than	553.0	553.1
just	553.1	553.2
season	553.2	553.8
seats.	553.8	554.1
I	561.9	562.2
didn't	562.2	562.5
mean	562.5	562.7
that.	562.7	563.0
I	564.2	564.3
just	564.3	564.6
meant	564.6	564.8
that	564.8	564.9
the	564.9	565.0
apartment	565.0	565.5
is	565.5	565.6
worth	565.6	565.9
so	565.9	566.2
much	566.2	566.4
more.	566.4	566.7
And	568.6	572.1
the	572.1	572.1
Knicks	572.1	572.4
rule.	572.4	572.8
Hey	575.9	576.2
so	576.2	576.7
are	576.7	577.3
you	577.3	577.4
going	577.4	577.5
to	577.5	577.5
do	577.5	577.7
it?	577.7	577.9
No,	579.0	579.4
no,	579.4	579.5
we're	579.5	580.3
not	580.3	580.4
going	580.4	580.5
to	580.5	580.7
do	580.7	580.7
that.	580.7	580.8
You	580.8	581.0
know	581.0	581.0
why?	581.0	581.3
Because	581.3	581.4
it's	581.4	581.6
not	581.6	581.8
an	581.8	581.8
even	581.8	582.1
trade.	582.1	582.2
Let	588.8	589.1
me	589.1	589.3
finish	589.3	589.7
talking	589.7	590.5
about	590.5	590.6
a	590.6	590.8
bet	590.8	591.1
winner-takes-all.	591.1	592.0
I'm	598.3	598.7
so	598.7	598.8
what	598.8	598.9
do	598.9	599.0
you	599.0	599.0
say?	599.0	599.2
On	605.4	606.1
man,	606.1	606.5
you	606.5	607.0
know,	607.0	607.1
I	607.1	607.2
do	607.2	607.4
it	607.4	607.5
for	607.5	607.7
you	607.7	607.8
because	607.8	609.0
you're	609.0	609.2
my	609.2	609.4
best	609.4	609.5
friend.	609.5	609.9
All	611.8	612.2
right,	612.2	612.4
but	612.4	612.6
you	612.6	612.6
can't	612.6	613.1
use	613.1	613.2
that	613.2	613.4
again	613.4	613.9
for	613.9	614.0
a	614.0	614.1
whole	614.1	614.2
year.	614.2	614.4
I	616.3	616.6
meant.	616.6	617.0
We	622.9	623.1
should	623.1	623.3
let	623.3	623.4
Stevie	623.4	623.7
decide	623.7	624.1
because	624.1	624.2
she's	624.2	624.5
the	624.5	624.6
only	624.6	624.7
one	624.7	625.0
who's	625.0	625.3
in	625.3	625.4
partial	625.4	625.9
and	625.9	626.0
she's	626.0	626.4
so	626.4	626.6
pretty.	626.6	627.0
OK,	633.5	633.8
Google	633.8	634.2
What's	635.1	635.6
the	635.6	635.6
name?	635.6	635.8
What's	635.8	636.0
the	636.0	636.0
name?	636.0	637.6
It	641.5	642.0
doesn't	642.0	642.3
have	642.3	642.4
a	642.4	642.5
name.	642.5	642.5
Okay.	644.3	644.8
