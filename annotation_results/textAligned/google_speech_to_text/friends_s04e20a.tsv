the	479.0	479.2
place,	479.2	479.6

no,	505.9	506.1
let	506.1	506.6

No,	509.8	510.3

me	511.1	511.2
in	511.2	511.3
right	511.3	511.6
now.	511.6	511.9
Are	514.2	514.6

alone?	514.7	514.9
Yes.	514.9	515.7
All	517.3	517.6
right.	517.6	517.9
Sucks	527.0	528.0
to	528.0	528.8
stay	528.8	529.5
up	529.5	529.7
all	529.7	529.9
night	529.9	530.2
before	530.2	530.5
I	530.5	530.6
go	530.6	530.6
to	530.6	530.8
the	530.8	531.0
stupid	531.0	531.3
Sleep	531.3	531.9
Clinic.	531.9	532.3
Hi,	538.9	539.3
I	539.3	541.0
hear	541.0	541.2
that.	541.2	541.3
You	541.3	541.4
and	541.4	541.5
Josh	541.5	541.8
were	541.8	541.9
going	541.9	542.2
out	542.2	542.3
to	542.3	542.3
dinner	542.3	542.4
with	542.4	542.7
Ross	542.7	542.8
and	542.8	543.0
Emily	543.0	543.3
and	543.3	543.3
I	543.3	543.5
think	543.5	543.7
that's	543.7	543.8
I	543.8	544.4
think	544.4	544.5
it's	544.5	544.7
really	544.7	544.9
cool.	544.9	545.1
I	545.1	546.4
think	546.4	546.5
you're	546.5	546.7
handling	546.7	547.0
it	547.0	547.2
really	547.2	547.4
well	547.4	547.7
and	547.7	551.0
handling	551.0	551.3
a	551.3	551.5
candle	551.5	552.5
or	552.5	553.1
maybe	553.1	553.5
I	553.5	553.7
would	553.7	553.9
have	553.9	553.9
a	553.9	554.1
problem	554.1	554.3
with	554.3	554.6
this.	554.6	554.8
If	554.8	555.0
it	555.0	555.1
wasn't	555.1	555.2
for	555.2	555.5
me	555.5	555.5
and	555.5	555.7
Joshua,	555.7	556.2
no,	557.5	558.0
they're	558.0	558.2
not	558.2	558.2
going	558.2	558.4
to	558.4	558.5
get	558.5	558.6
married.	558.6	558.9
Anyway,	558.9	559.4
they	559.4	562.1
rushed	562.1	562.5
into	562.5	562.6
this	562.6	562.8
thing	562.8	563.0
so	563.0	563.3
fast.	563.3	563.8
It's	563.8	564.0
ridiculous	564.0	564.7
when	564.7	565.4
they're	565.4	565.5
going	565.5	565.6
to	565.6	565.6
be	565.6	565.7
engaged	565.7	565.9
for	565.9	566.3
like,	566.3	566.5
what	566.5	566.8
a	566.8	567.4
year	567.4	567.7
to	567.7	568.5
somewhere	568.5	568.9
along	568.9	569.1
the	569.1	569.3
way.	569.3	569.3
One	569.3	569.7
of	569.7	569.7
them	569.7	569.8
is	569.8	569.9
going	569.9	570.0
to	570.0	570.1
realize	570.1	570.5
what	570.5	570.9
they've	570.9	571.1
done	571.1	571.2
to	571.2	571.4
call	571.4	571.9
the	571.9	572.0
whole	572.0	572.1
thing	572.1	572.1
off.	572.1	572.5
I'm	572.5	573.4
telling	573.4	573.7
you,	573.7	573.8
you're	573.8	573.9
going	573.9	574.0
to	574.0	574.1
dance	574.1	574.4
in	574.4	574.4
my	574.4	574.6
wedding.	574.6	575.0
Isn't	575.0	575.4
it?	575.4	575.6
There's	575.6	575.9
Because	579.4	580.5
weddings	580.5	580.8
are	580.8	580.9
a	580.9	581.0
great	581.0	581.2
place	581.2	581.4
to	581.4	581.5
meet	581.5	581.6
women.	581.6	581.8
And	581.8	582.3
when	582.3	582.4
I	582.4	582.4
dance,	582.4	582.8
I	582.8	583.3
look	583.3	583.5
like	583.5	583.6
this.	583.6	583.8
So,	598.9	599.2
what	599.2	599.4
are	599.4	599.5
you	599.5	599.6
guys	599.6	599.7
doing	599.7	600.1
for	600.1	600.3
weeks	600.3	600.9
from	600.9	601.0
today,	601.0	601.4
nothing.	601.4	602.1
Great.	606.5	607.1
Because	607.1	609.6
Emily	609.6	610.2
and	610.2	610.3
I	610.3	610.4
are	610.4	610.4
getting	610.4	610.7
married	610.7	610.7
in	610.7	611.2
a	611.2	611.2
month.	611.2	611.2
In	612.7	615.1
a	615.1	615.1
month,	615.1	615.5
in	615.5	616.8
30	616.8	617.1
days.	617.1	617.4
From	619.2	619.6
now.	619.6	619.8
I	622.0	624.0
always	624.0	624.5
wanted	624.5	624.6
to	624.6	624.8
get	624.8	624.9
married	624.9	625.0
in	625.0	625.2
this	625.2	625.4
beautiful	625.4	625.6
place	625.6	626.2
at	626.2	626.4
her	626.4	626.5
parents	626.5	626.9
got	626.9	627.1
married	627.1	627.3
but	627.3	627.6
it's	627.6	627.8
going	627.8	628.0
to	628.0	628.0
be	628.0	628.1
torn	628.1	628.5
down.	628.5	628.6
So	628.6	629.7
I	629.7	630.8
mean,	630.8	631.0
I	631.0	631.0
know	631.0	631.1
it's	631.1	631.5
crazy	631.5	631.7
but	631.7	632.0
everything	632.0	632.6
else	632.6	632.8
and	632.8	632.9
I	632.9	633.0
was	633.0	633.2
been	633.2	633.3
so	633.3	633.5
crazy,	633.5	633.7
it	633.7	634.9
just	634.9	635.5
feels	635.5	635.9
right,	635.9	636.1
you	636.1	636.3
know	636.3	636.5
that's	636.5	638.1
a	638.1	638.2
day	638.2	638.3
after	638.3	638.5
I	638.5	638.6
start.	638.6	638.9
this	651.1	651.4
isn't	651.4	651.7
my	651.7	651.8
