It's	8.9	9.3
okay	9.3	9.6
not	9.6	9.7
to	9.7	9.8
talk.	9.8	10.2
Barry	11.9	14.3
and	14.3	14.4
Mindy	14.4	14.9

go	26.6	26.9
to	26.9	26.9
Ross.	26.9	27.3
Friend	33.4	34.0

you	35.5	35.7
with	35.7	35.7
her.	35.7	35.9
Yeah	35.9	36.4
but	36.4	36.7
that	36.7	36.8
just	36.8	37.0
means	37.0	37.2
that	37.2	37.3
he	37.3	37.4
was	37.4	37.6
falling	37.6	37.9
asleep	37.9	37.9
on	37.9	38.3
top	38.3	38.4
of	38.4	38.6
her.	38.6	38.7
Instead	38.7	39.0
of	39.0	39.1
me	39.1	39.2
Why	41.1	41.4
do	41.4	41.4
they	41.4	41.5
get	41.5	41.6
divorced?	41.6	41.8
Well,	41.8	42.5

I'd	51.3	51.4
actually	51.4	51.6
married	51.6	52.2
him.	52.2	52.4
I	52.4	52.5
mean,	52.5	52.7
how	52.7	52.8
different	52.8	53.5
would	53.5	53.7
my	53.7	53.8
life	53.8	54.0
be?	54.0	54.4
I	54.4	54.9
don't.	54.9	55.0
You	55.0	55.2
mean,	55.2	55.5
I've	55.5	55.8
always	55.8	56.0
wondered	56.0	56.4
how	56.4	56.5
different	56.5	56.9
my	56.9	57.0
life	57.0	57.1
would	57.1	57.4
be.	57.4	57.7
If	57.7	57.8

if	63.8	63.9
Carol	63.9	64.3
had	64.3	64.6
realized	64.6	65.3
she	65.3	65.3
was	65.3	65.5
a	65.5	65.5
lesbian	65.5	65.7
Why	66.5	68.4

I	68.9	69.4
keep	69.4	69.6
saying	69.6	69.8
it's	69.8	70.0
a	70.0	70.0
good	70.0	70.1
way?	70.1	70.4
I	74.2	74.5
bet	74.5	74.7
I'd	74.7	74.9

to	117.7	117.8
be	117.8	117.9
funny,	117.9	118.3
but	118.3	119.5
it's	119.5	119.9
fun	119.9	120.1
to.	120.1	120.2
I	120.2	120.5

tomorrow	120.7	121.6
at,	121.6	122.0
I	122.0	122.6
don't	122.6	122.8
have	122.8	122.9
to	122.9	123.0
work,	123.0	123.2
but	123.2	125.9
if	125.9	126.0
I	126.0	126.2
taken	126.2	126.7
that	126.7	126.8
job	126.8	126.9
at	126.9	127.2
Merrill	127.2	127.4
Lynch,	127.4	127.5
Yeah,	129.8	130.2
I	130.2	130.5
had	130.5	130.7
a	130.7	130.7
massage	130.7	130.9
client	130.9	131.5
who	131.5	131.7
work	131.7	131.9
there	131.9	132.1
and	132.1	132.4
and	132.4	132.5
he	132.5	132.9
said,	132.9	133.2
I	133.2	133.3
had	133.3	133.4
an	133.4	133.6
app	133.6	133.8

you	135.0	135.2
take	135.2	135.3

time,	136.9	137.3
you	137.3	137.5
see?	137.5	137.7

I	141.3	141.4

All	151.8	152.3
those	152.3	152.6
things	152.6	152.8
happened,	152.8	153.7
