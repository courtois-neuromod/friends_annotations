I	25.5	25.8
don't	25.8	25.9

I	32.9	34.5
think	34.5	34.7
you've	34.7	34.8
had	34.8	34.9
enough	34.9	35.0

contribution	51.4	53.6
brings	53.6	53.9
us	53.9	54.1
a	54.1	54.1
big	54.1	54.4
step	54.4	54.7
closer	54.7	54.9
to	54.9	55.1
building	55.1	55.4
the	55.4	55.5
youth	55.5	55.7
center.	55.7	56.0
I	56.0	56.8
can't	56.8	57.2
tell	57.2	57.4
you	57.4	57.5
how	57.5	57.6
happy	57.6	57.7
I	57.7	58.1

You	58.2	58.3
brought	58.3	58.6
him	58.6	58.8
out	58.8	61.8
of	61.8	61.9
curiosity.	61.9	62.1
How	62.1	62.7
much	62.7	62.9
is	62.9	63.1
that	63.1	63.2
boat	63.2	63.5
worth?	63.5	63.9
I	63.9	64.2
think	64.2	64.3
it	64.3	64.4
was	64.4	64.5
valued	64.5	64.8
at	64.8	64.9
19000.	64.9	66.1
So	70.0	73.1
bad	73.1	73.6
news.	73.6	74.0
I	74.0	75.1
can't	75.1	75.4

money.	76.8	77.0
Hahaha.	83.2	85.9
So,	92.8	93.2

Quit	104.9	105.6
that	105.6	105.7
kind	105.7	105.9

We're	108.3	110.0
going	110.0	110.2

Richard.	195.8	197.1
That's	197.1	201.9
right.	201.9	202.4
That's	202.4	202.6
right.	202.6	202.8
That's	202.8	202.9
Richard's	202.9	203.4
favorite	203.4	203.6
place	203.6	204.0

knew	204.8	204.9
that	204.9	205.0
good?	205.0	206.1
I	207.8	208.1
thought	208.1	208.3
you	208.3	208.4
were	208.4	208.4
going	208.4	208.5
out	208.5	208.6
with	208.6	208.7
Elizabeth.	208.7	209.0
Yeah,	209.0	210.2
I	210.2	210.5
was,	210.5	210.8
but	210.8	210.9
she	210.9	211.4
was	211.4	211.6
a	211.6	211.7
little	211.7	211.8
busy	211.8	212.1
with	212.1	212.3
a	212.3	212.4

Remember	218.5	219.1
she	219.1	219.2
is	219.2	219.4
too	219.4	219.7
young	219.7	219.8
for	219.8	220.2
me	220.2	220.3
when	220.3	221.3
I	221.3	221.3
was	221.3	221.5
over	221.5	221.8
there	221.8	221.8
and	221.8	222.0
she	222.0	222.1
was	222.1	222.3
running	222.3	222.6
around	222.6	222.7
with	222.7	223.0
her	223.0	223.1
friends.	223.1	223.5
I	223.5	223.6
felt	223.6	223.9
like	223.9	224.0
I	224.0	224.1
was	224.1	224.1
a	224.1	224.3
babysitter.	224.3	225.1
I	225.1	225.7
finally	225.7	226.2
started	226.2	226.4
to	226.4	226.5
see	226.5	226.6
what	226.6	226.8
you	226.8	226.9
guys	226.9	226.9
were	226.9	227.1
talking	227.1	227.4
about.	227.4	227.7
I	227.7	228.8
don't	228.8	228.9
want	228.9	229.0

the	230.8	230.9
good	230.9	231.1
stuff	231.1	231.2
about	231.2	231.5
the	231.5	231.7
relationship	231.7	232.3
against	232.3	232.6
the	232.6	232.6
bad	232.6	232.9
stuff	232.9	233.2
and	233.2	233.7
that's	233.7	233.8
what	233.8	234.0
I	234.0	234.1
did.	234.1	234.4
When	234.4	234.5
I	234.5	234.6
first	234.6	234.7
started	234.7	234.9
doing	234.9	236.3
stuff	236.3	236.7
years	236.7	242.6
older	242.6	243.0
than	243.0	243.1
she	243.1	243.3

She's	244.1	246.3

She's	253.2	253.7
sweet	253.7	254.7
and	254.7	254.8
pretty.	254.8	255.1
And	255.1	255.7

probably	256.4	256.7
pretty	256.7	256.9
great.	256.9	257.2
I	257.2	257.2
thought	257.2	257.6
it's	257.6	260.4
what	260.4	262.4
you	262.4	262.5
mean.	262.5	262.8
Lacrosse,	265.5	266.5

Oh	273.4	273.7
