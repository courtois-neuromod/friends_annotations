We	50.4	51.4
just,	51.4	51.7
we	51.7	52.4
just	52.4	52.4
think	52.4	52.9
that	52.9	52.9
you're	52.9	53.1
having	53.1	53.4

that,	58.9	59.0
maybe	59.0	59.2
she's	59.2	59.4
being	59.4	59.6
a	59.6	59.7

Unreasonable,	64.8	67.5
we	67.5	67.8

make	73.2	73.4
a	73.4	73.4
marriage	73.4	73.8

it's	74.9	75.1
about	75.1	75.3
compromise.	75.3	75.8
You	75.8	76.4

guilty	107.3	107.7
about	107.7	107.9
Ross,	107.9	108.6

None	118.1	118.7

this	118.8	118.9
would	118.9	119.1
have	119.1	119.2
happened,	119.2	119.3
but	119.3	120.3
I'm	120.3	120.5

bound	123.2	123.4
to	123.4	123.6
slip	123.6	123.8
out.	123.8	124.0
Well,	126.3	126.7
I	126.7	126.7
think	126.7	126.9
it's	126.9	127.1
very	127.1	127.2
brave.	127.2	127.3
What	127.3	127.8

be	146.7	146.8
