Would	23.1	26.2
you	26.2	26.3
feel	26.3	27.2

all	30.4	30.5
this	30.5	30.7
stuff	30.7	30.9
up	30.9	31.3

go	31.9	32.0
to	32.0	32.1

my	37.6	37.7
parents	37.7	37.8

We	38.2	38.3
could	38.3	38.4
go	38.4	38.6
there.	38.6	38.7
Huge	41.9	43.8
places	43.8	44.7
in	44.7	45.1
a	45.1	45.1
very	45.1	47.6
romantic.	47.6	47.8
The	54.5	55.2
smell	55.2	55.6
of	55.6	55.7
fear.	55.7	56.0
I	62.8	63.1
asked	63.1	63.4
him	63.4	63.5
if	63.5	63.5
he	63.5	63.7
wanted	63.7	64.0
to	64.0	64.0
eat.	64.0	64.2
He	64.2	64.5
said,	64.5	64.8
no?	64.8	65.0
I	65.0	65.5
asked	65.5	65.8
him	65.8	65.9
if	65.9	65.9
he	65.9	66.1
wanted	66.1	66.3
to	66.3	66.4
sleep.	66.4	66.6
He	66.6	67.0
said,	67.0	67.3
no,	67.3	67.5
I	67.5	68.0
asked	68.0	68.3
him	68.3	68.5
what	68.5	68.7
he	68.7	68.9
wanted	68.9	69.2
to	69.2	69.5
do.	69.5	69.7
He	69.7	70.0
said,	70.0	70.4
no.	70.4	70.6
So	70.6	71.2
he's	71.2	71.6
sweeping	71.6	71.9
so,	75.2	76.5
any	78.0	78.4
word	78.4	78.6
from	78.6	78.7
Susan	78.7	79.3

much	81.6	81.8
fun	81.8	82.1
with	82.1	82.3
him.	82.3	82.4
Did	85.3	87.5
it	87.5	87.6
ever	87.6	88.4
occur	88.4	88.9
to	88.9	89.2
you?	89.2	89.3
That	89.3	89.5
there	89.5	91.0
might	91.0	91.0
be	91.0	91.2
a	91.2	91.3
little	91.3	91.6
too	91.6	92.5
much	92.5	92.8
fun.	92.8	93.1
What's	94.1	94.7
too	94.7	94.9
much	94.9	94.9
fun?	94.9	95.5
You	95.5	97.4
and	97.4	97.6
Susan	97.6	98.0
had	98.0	98.3
when	98.3	98.5
we	98.5	98.6
were	98.6	98.7

A	108.8	109.0
loving	109.0	109.4
committed	109.4	110.1
relationship.	110.1	110.9
So	110.9	112.3
were	112.3	112.6
we	112.6	112.8
just	112.8	114.6
for	114.6	116.0
a	116.0	116.1
moment	116.1	116.3
that	116.3	117.2
Susan	117.2	117.7
meet	117.7	118.0
someone	118.0	118.4
and	118.4	118.9
then	118.9	119.0
they	119.0	119.2
really	119.2	119.7
hit	119.7	119.8
it	119.8	119.9
off,	119.9	120.1
they	120.1	120.4
say	120.4	120.8

Laughing.	125.6	126.5
You're	126.5	126.8
okay	126.8	127.2

someone	127.3	127.5
innocently	127.5	128.6
touches	128.6	129.3
someone	129.3	129.5

There's	131.2	131.6

isn't	136.1	136.4
even	136.4	136.5
the	136.5	136.7
slightest	136.7	137.6
possibility	137.6	138.3
of	138.3	138.7
something	138.7	139.1
happening?	139.1	139.2
Maybe.	142.0	142.8
Oh	142.8	143.1
my	143.1	143.3
God,	143.3	143.7
I	143.7	143.8

believe.	144.2	144.3
You	151.4	151.8
know,	151.8	152.0
none	152.0	152.1

me.	152.9	153.0
I	153.0	153.1
swear	153.1	153.4
to	153.4	153.5
God.	153.5	153.6
That	153.6	153.8
duck	153.8	154.4

Wow,	157.0	157.5

fabulous	158.9	159.8
downstairs,	159.8	162.6
living	162.6	162.9

Two	163.6	164.0

rooms	164.3	164.8
growing	164.8	166.0
up	166.0	166.2
here.	166.2	166.4
This	166.4	166.5
place	166.5	166.7
must	166.7	167.0
have	167.0	167.1
been	167.1	167.2
a	167.2	167.3
real	167.3	167.8
big	167.8	168.2
magnet.	168.2	168.9
It	170.2	170.8
would	170.8	170.9
have	170.9	171.0
been	171.0	171.1
but	171.1	171.4
a	171.4	171.8
just	171.8	172.4

out?	178.0	178.2
And	181.5	181.7
here's	181.7	181.9
an	181.9	182.0
idea.	182.0	182.1
Why	182.1	182.4
don't	182.4	182.5
I	182.5	183.9
put	183.9	184.1
the	184.1	184.2
food	184.2	184.5
in	184.5	184.7
the	184.7	184.8
fridge	184.8	185.2
and	185.2	186.0
we	186.0	186.3
can	186.3	186.5
eat	186.5	186.7
it	186.7	186.9
later	186.9	187.0
like	187.0	188.8

This	209.5	210.6
may	210.6	210.7
be	210.7	210.8
a	210.8	210.9
little	210.9	211.0
weird	211.0	211.2
but	211.2	211.5
I	211.5	211.7
got	211.7	212.3
to	212.3	212.5
pay	212.5	212.7

No	213.0	214.1

end.	289.4	289.7
This	289.7	290.1
is	290.1	290.4
a	290.4	290.5
real	290.5	291.0
dress	291.0	291.8
actually.	291.8	292.4

how	299.4	299.7
people	299.7	299.9

The	410.2	410.6
