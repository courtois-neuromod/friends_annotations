only	93.1	93.2
reason	93.2	93.3
he's	93.3	93.5

party	99.0	99.1
but	99.1	99.4
it's	99.4	99.6
so	99.6	99.9
cliche.	99.9	100.2
Why	100.2	101.5
don't	101.5	101.6
you	101.6	101.7

with	121.6	121.9
him.	121.9	122.1
He	122.1	122.5
should	122.5	122.7
have	122.7	122.7
seen	122.7	122.8
the	122.8	123.0
hug	123.0	123.3

got	124.0	124.2
the	124.2	124.4
job	124.4	124.4
and	124.4	125.1
end	125.1	125.5
and	125.5	125.7
he's	125.7	125.8
really	125.8	126.2
good	126.2	126.3
looking.	126.3	126.7
When	129.3	129.7

Don't	136.6	137.1
cry	137.1	137.3

audition	142.5	142.7
for	142.7	142.9
a	142.9	143.0
Broadway	143.0	143.4
musical.	143.4	143.5
I	143.5	144.4
want	144.4	144.6

an	145.9	146.0
easy	146.0	146.2
answer.	146.2	146.7
It	148.2	148.6

makes	519.2	519.4
him	519.4	519.5
even	519.5	519.7
sexier.	519.7	520.1
Like	520.1	520.6
