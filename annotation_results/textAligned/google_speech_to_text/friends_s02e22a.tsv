she	82.9	83.1
doesn't	83.1	83.3
steal	83.3	83.6

Well	273.3	273.7

were	277.8	277.9
Rachel	277.9	278.1
and	278.1	278.5
we	278.5	278.6
just	278.6	278.8
weren't	278.8	278.9

No,	295.4	295.9
I'll	295.9	296.6
take	296.6	296.8
that	296.8	297.0

nice	305.2	305.6
effective.	305.6	306.6
Play	312.2	312.5
here.	312.5	313.0
I	313.0	313.3
was	313.3	313.5
driving.	313.5	314.2
Hear	319.5	319.7
the	319.7	319.8
rest	319.8	320.1
of	320.1	320.2
it.	320.2	320.3
Now	320.3	320.5
if	320.5	320.7
I	320.7	320.8
really	320.8	321.1
have	321.1	321.2
to	321.2	321.3
go	321.3	321.4
to	321.4	321.5
the	321.5	321.6
bathroom,	321.6	321.9
so	321.9	322.5
come	322.5	323.7
with	323.7	323.9
me.	323.9	324.0
Gal.	326.2	326.7
Pals,	326.7	327.0
you	327.0	327.3
know,	327.3	327.4
like	327.4	327.6
at	327.6	327.8
a	327.8	327.8
restaurant,	327.8	327.9
What	337.4	339.9
would	339.9	340.0
Jack	340.0	340.2
and	340.2	340.3
Chrissy	340.3	340.6
do?	340.6	340.7
Okay,	343.6	344.2
now	344.2	344.5
your	344.5	344.8
coat	344.8	345.1
is	345.1	345.2
safely.	345.2	345.8
Joey	350.3	351.0
and	351.0	351.1
Chandler.	351.1	351.4
I	351.4	351.5
think	351.5	351.9
it's	351.9	352.0
time	352.0	352.1
that	352.1	352.2
you	352.2	352.3
take	352.3	352.6
Dr.	352.6	353.1
Green	353.1	353.4
over	353.4	353.6
to	353.6	353.7
your	353.7	353.9
place.	353.9	354.1
because	360.0	360.4
that's	360.4	360.7
where	360.7	360.8
the	360.8	360.9
party	360.9	361.3
is	361.3	361.4
you	361.4	361.8
going,	361.8	362.4
if	362.4	362.7
this	362.7	364.5
is	364.5	364.6
just	364.6	364.8
a	364.8	364.9
