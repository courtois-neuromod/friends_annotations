lately.	378.7	379.2
I	379.2	379.7
feel	379.7	380.1
like	380.1	380.3
you're	380.3	380.4
slipping	380.4	380.6
away	380.6	380.8
from	380.8	381.1
me	381.1	381.3
if	381.3	381.5
you	381.5	381.6
know	381.6	381.8
what	381.8	382.0
this	382.0	382.1
new	382.1	382.3
job	382.3	382.6
and	382.6	382.9
all	382.9	383.0
these	383.0	383.2
new	383.2	383.4
people	383.4	383.7
and	383.7	384.2
got	384.2	384.9
this	384.9	385.0
whole	385.0	385.3
other	385.3	385.5
life	385.5	386.1
going	386.1	386.9
on,	386.9	387.0
and	387.0	387.3
I	387.3	387.5
know	387.5	387.9
it's	387.9	388.5
dumb	388.5	389.6
but	389.6	389.7
I	389.7	390.3
hate	390.3	391.5
that.	391.5	391.7
I'm	391.7	392.0
not	392.0	392.2
a	392.2	392.3
part	392.3	392.6
of	392.6	392.6
it.	392.6	392.7
But	401.3	401.7
maybe	401.7	402.0
it's	402.0	402.2
okay	402.2	402.4
that	402.4	402.8
you're	402.8	402.9
not	402.9	402.9
a	402.9	403.1
part	403.1	403.3
of	403.3	403.5
it.	403.5	403.6
You	404.6	405.0
know	405.0	405.1
what	405.1	405.2
I	405.2	405.3
mean?	405.3	405.4
I	407.2	408.0
mean,	408.0	408.2
it's	408.2	408.4
like	408.4	408.5
I	408.5	408.7
said,	408.7	408.9
I	408.9	409.1
like	409.1	409.5
that	409.5	410.0
you're	410.0	410.2
not	410.2	410.3
involved	410.3	411.1
in	411.1	411.5
that	411.5	411.7
part	411.7	412.0
of	412.0	412.1
my	412.1	412.2
life.	412.2	412.3
That's	413.7	414.2
a	414.2	414.3
little	414.3	414.4
clearer.	414.4	414.9
I	417.9	418.0
mean	418.0	418.3
that	418.3	418.6
I	418.6	418.7
don't	418.7	418.9
love	418.9	419.1
you	419.1	419.5
because	419.5	419.9
I	419.9	420.3
do	420.3	420.7
I	420.7	420.9
love	420.9	421.2
you,	421.2	421.3
I	421.3	421.5
love	421.5	421.6
you	421.6	421.8
so	421.8	422.1
much	422.1	422.2
but	422.2	423.4
my	423.4	423.6
work	423.6	424.1
it's	424.1	424.5
it's	424.5	424.9
for	424.9	425.1
me	425.1	425.3
you	425.3	425.7
know,	425.7	425.9
I'm	425.9	426.2
out	426.2	426.4
there	426.4	426.6
on	426.6	426.9
my	426.9	427.0
own	427.0	427.2
and	427.2	427.5
I'm	427.5	427.7
doing	427.7	427.9
it	427.9	428.2
and	428.2	428.7
it's	428.7	428.9
scary	428.9	429.5
but	429.5	430.0
I	430.0	430.1
love	430.1	430.5
it	430.5	430.6
because	430.6	430.8
it's	430.8	431.2
mine.	431.2	431.6
But	433.4	434.0
I	434.0	434.0
mean	434.0	434.2
is	434.2	434.3
that	434.3	434.5
okay?	434.5	434.6

No,	451.0	451.4

the	452.7	452.8
deal	452.8	453.0
with	453.0	453.2
that	453.2	453.3
again?	453.3	453.5
It's	455.5	455.8
okay	455.8	456.0
if	456.0	456.2
it	456.2	456.3
bothers	456.3	456.7
you	456.7	456.8
the	456.8	458.1
only	458.1	458.3
thing	458.3	458.4

bothers	459.9	460.2
you?	460.2	460.3
Cuz	460.3	460.8

Am	463.6	464.0

That's,	487.9	488.4
that's	488.4	488.6
my	488.6	488.7
number.	488.7	489.1
It's	497.4	497.6
kind	497.6	497.8
of	497.8	497.8
a	497.8	497.9
third	497.9	499.5
nipple,	499.5	499.6
kind	499.6	500.1

nipples	503.7	504.2
and	504.2	507.8
one	507.8	508.9
that	508.9	509.0
barely	509.0	509.3
qualifies	509.3	510.2
as	510.2	510.3
What	513.5	514.3
nothing?	514.3	514.9
I	514.9	515.3
do.	515.3	515.5
I	515.5	516.6

Okay,	544.9	545.2

I	548.8	549.1
played	549.1	549.6
smelly	549.6	549.7
cat	549.7	550.2
for	550.2	550.3
the	550.3	550.4
people	550.4	550.6
of	550.6	550.7
my	550.7	550.9
old	550.9	551.1
Ad	551.1	551.3
Agency.	551.3	551.5
They	551.5	551.9

nuts.	552.1	552.5
I	552.5	554.3
told	554.3	554.6
you	554.6	554.8

I	555.1	555.2
didn't	555.2	555.4
want	555.4	555.5

Anyway,	559.4	559.8
You	561.1	562.7
know	562.7	562.8
what,	562.8	563.0
I	563.0	563.1
think,	563.1	563.3
five	563.3	563.6
years	563.6	563.8
ago,	563.8	564.0
I	564.0	564.2
probably	564.2	564.5
would	564.5	564.7
have	564.7	564.7
done	564.7	564.9
anything	564.9	565.4
to	565.4	565.7
play	565.7	566.5
with	566.5	566.6
you,	566.6	566.9
but	566.9	567.0
I	567.0	567.5
can't	567.5	567.6
do	567.6	567.9
it	567.9	567.9
by	567.9	568.1
myself	568.1	568.2
Ryan.	568.2	568.9
And	568.9	569.0
if	569.0	569.1
I	569.1	569.2
can't	569.2	569.5
trust	569.5	569.7
you,	569.7	569.9
then	569.9	570.1
just	570.1	570.3
forget	570.3	570.4
it.	570.4	570.8
I	570.8	571.4
don't	571.4	571.4
want	571.4	571.7
to	571.7	571.9
forget	571.9	572.0
it.	572.0	572.6
You	572.6	573.2
know	573.2	573.3
what,	573.3	573.4
you	573.4	573.6
have	573.6	573.8
to	573.8	573.9
choose.	573.9	574.4
All	574.4	574.7
right.	574.7	575.0
If	575.0	575.2
the	575.2	576.5
most	576.5	576.6
important	576.6	577.1
thing	577.1	577.3
on	577.3	577.4
the	577.4	577.6
planet	577.6	577.8
to	577.8	578.2
you	578.2	578.3
is	578.3	578.5
a	578.5	578.6
cat	578.6	579.3
pooping	579.3	579.6
thing,	579.6	580.0
then,	580.0	580.3
okay,	580.3	582.1
you	582.1	582.3
can	582.3	582.4
have	582.4	582.5
smelly	582.5	583.0
cat,	583.0	583.3
but	583.3	583.9
we	583.9	584.0
won't	584.0	584.1
be	584.1	584.2
partners.	584.2	584.8
So	584.8	586.5
what's	586.5	586.7

You	609.6	611.2

hopefully	612.8	613.3
you	613.3	613.4
grow.	613.4	613.5
Want	615.2	615.7
to	615.7	615.7

Why	664.4	664.8
didn't	664.8	665.0
I	665.0	665.1
think	665.1	665.1
of	665.1	665.4
