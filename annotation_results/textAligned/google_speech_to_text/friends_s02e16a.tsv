me	172.1	172.4
until	172.4	172.7
I	172.7	172.9
do.	172.9	173.0
I'm	173.0	173.1
not	173.1	173.2
telling	173.2	173.5
him	173.5	173.5
anything,	173.5	173.6
I	173.6	174.4
don't	174.4	174.5
know,	174.5	174.6
I	174.6	174.7
don't	174.7	174.9
think	174.9	174.9
Mom	174.9	175.3
and	175.3	175.3
Dad	175.3	175.4
would	175.4	175.7
mind	175.7	175.9
to	175.9	179.3
say	179.3	179.5
God.	179.5	180.2
I	180.2	180.3
hope	180.3	180.5
they	180.5	180.7

together.	180.8	181.1
Okay.	189.4	189.9
Where	193.8	194.9

Are	223.0	223.1
you	223.1	223.2
not	223.2	223.4
nervous?	223.4	223.9
This	223.9	224.9
is	224.9	225.0
just	225.0	225.2
a	225.2	225.3
very	225.3	225.3
absorbent	225.3	225.7
suit.	225.7	226.3
Not,	235.2	235.6
unless	235.6	236.2
this	236.2	236.4
looks	236.4	236.8
like	236.8	236.9
we're	236.9	237.0
trying	237.0	237.0
to	237.0	237.4

something	237.6	237.9
up	237.9	238.0
with	238.0	238.3
him,	238.3	240.2
but	240.2	240.5
I	240.5	240.5
still	240.5	240.7
wouldn't	240.7	240.9
believe	240.9	241.2
it.	241.2	241.5
Actually,	244.3	257.3
mom,	257.3	257.5

So	262.2	262.6
you	262.6	263.2
could	263.2	263.4
take	263.4	263.6
the	263.6	263.7

pretty	291.4	294.2
young	294.2	295.1

everything	295.6	295.9
is	295.9	296.2
still	296.2	296.3

he	567.2	567.5
told	567.5	567.8
Johnny,	567.8	568.1
that	568.1	568.2

Yeah,	574.8	575.1
I	575.1	575.2

checking	604.4	604.7
out	604.7	604.9

moldings.	605.0	605.4
Why	607.1	607.4

I	608.3	608.4
want	608.4	608.6
another	608.6	608.8

All	618.3	618.7

You	619.0	619.7
want	619.7	619.8
the	619.8	619.9
truth?	619.9	620.2
I'm	621.2	621.6

What?	623.4	624.0
I'm	624.0	624.5
sorry.	624.5	624.8
I'm	624.8	625.6
28	625.6	626.1
years	626.1	626.2

I've	626.4	626.8
never	626.8	627.0
lived	627.0	627.2
alone	627.2	627.4
and	627.4	627.7
I'm	627.7	627.9
finally	627.9	629.1
at	629.1	629.2
a	629.2	629.3
place	629.3	629.7
where	629.7	629.9
I	629.9	630.0
got	630.0	630.2
enough	630.2	630.5
money,	630.5	630.5
that	630.5	630.8
I	630.8	631.0
don't	631.0	631.3
need	631.3	632.0
a	632.0	632.2
roommate	632.2	632.5
anymore,	632.5	632.8
a	632.8	635.6
roommate	635.6	636.0
either.	636.0	636.1
Okay,	636.1	637.0
I	637.0	637.1
can	637.1	637.3
afford	637.3	637.5
to	637.5	637.7
live	637.7	637.9
here	637.9	638.0
by	638.0	638.2
myself	638.2	638.3
and	638.3	639.7
I	639.7	639.8
may	639.8	639.9
have	639.9	640.0
to	640.0	640.1
bring	640.1	640.2
in	640.2	640.4
somebody	640.4	640.6
once	640.6	640.9
a	640.9	641.0
week	641.0	641.1
to	641.1	641.2
lick	641.2	641.5
the	641.5	641.6
silverware.	641.6	642.2
What	642.2	644.6
are	644.6	644.7
you	644.7	644.7
getting	644.7	644.9
so	644.9	645.0
bent	645.0	645.2
out	645.2	645.5
of	645.5	645.6
shape	645.6	645.7
for	645.7	646.2
huh?	646.2	646.3
Sound	646.3	647.1
like	647.1	647.2
we	647.2	647.4
agreed	647.4	647.5
to	647.5	647.8
live	647.8	648.0
together	648.0	648.2
forever	648.2	648.6
without	648.6	649.6
Bert	649.6	649.9
and	649.9	650.0
Ernie?	650.0	650.2
I'm	653.0	653.4
aware	653.4	653.6
that	653.6	653.8
we're	653.8	653.9
not	653.9	654.1
gay	654.1	654.4
puppets,	654.4	655.3
all	655.3	655.9
right.	655.9	656.2
But	658.2	658.6
you	658.6	658.8
know	658.8	658.9
what,	658.9	659.1
if	659.1	659.8
this	659.8	659.9
is	659.9	660.0
the	660.0	660.1
way	660.1	660.2
you	660.2	660.4
feel,	660.4	660.5
then	660.5	661.9
maybe	661.9	661.9
you	661.9	662.2
should	662.2	662.4
take	662.4	662.5
it.	662.5	662.7
Well,	664.2	664.7
that's	664.7	664.9
how	664.9	665.0
I	665.0	665.2
feel.	665.2	665.4
You	665.4	665.9
should	665.9	666.1
take	666.1	666.4
it	666.4	666.5
for	666.5	667.0
that.	667.0	667.1
Maybe	667.1	667.4
I	667.4	667.5
will	667.5	667.7
find	667.7	668.2
with	668.2	668.3
me.	668.3	668.5
Who's	675.0	675.5

Okay.	692.2	692.4
Remember	692.4	693.9
