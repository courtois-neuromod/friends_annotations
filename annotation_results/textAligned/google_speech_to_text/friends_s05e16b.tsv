hand	152.1	152.4
moving	152.4	152.5
his	152.5	152.8
couch.	152.8	153.2
I	153.2	154.0
love	154.0	154.2
to,	154.2	154.4
but	154.4	154.5
I	154.5	154.7
got	154.7	154.8
to	154.8	154.8
acting	154.8	155.1
class.	155.1	155.5
But	155.5	156.5
you	156.5	156.5
know	156.5	156.7
what,	156.7	156.9
I	156.9	157.4
guess,	157.4	157.5
I	157.5	157.6
could	157.6	157.7
blow	157.7	157.9
that	157.9	158.0
off	158.0	158.1
for	158.1	159.0
you.	159.0	159.1
Let	165.6	166.7
me	166.7	166.8
ask	166.8	167.0
you	167.0	167.1
something.	167.1	167.5
I	167.5	168.3
was	168.3	168.4
just	168.4	168.6
over	168.6	168.8
there	168.8	168.8
talking	168.8	169.0
to	169.0	169.3
Monica	169.3	169.5
and	169.5	169.8
Chandler	169.8	170.2
and	170.2	170.4
where	170.4	170.6
they	170.6	170.8
are	170.8	170.9
really	170.9	171.3
tight.	171.3	171.7
Thinking	177.8	178.3
of	178.3	178.4
getting	178.4	178.4
me	178.4	178.6
one	178.6	178.8
of	178.8	178.9
those.	178.9	178.9
The	185.2	185.9
reason	185.9	186.3
I	186.3	186.6
think	186.6	186.6
Monica	186.6	187.0
and	187.0	187.2
Shannon.	187.2	187.4
So	187.4	187.8
great	187.8	188.2
is	188.2	188.8
because	188.8	189.1
they	189.1	189.3
were	189.3	189.3
friends	189.3	190.0
first,	190.0	190.1
you	190.1	191.1
know,	191.1	191.2
so	191.2	191.8
I	191.8	191.9
ask	191.9	192.1
myself	192.1	192.2
with	192.2	192.8
my	192.8	192.9
friends,	192.9	193.4
I	196.0	196.3
saw	196.3	196.6
you	196.6	196.8
first	196.8	197.0
so	197.0	197.5
What	199.9	201.7
do	201.7	201.8
you	201.8	201.8
say?	201.8	202.0
And	202.0	203.0
maybe	203.0	203.3
you	203.3	203.5
and	203.5	203.7
I	203.7	203.8
crank	203.8	204.2
it	204.2	204.3
up	204.3	204.4
a	204.4	204.6
notch.	204.6	204.9
As	210.5	212.0
that	212.0	212.4
as	212.4	212.5
flattered	212.5	213.1
as	213.1	213.3
I	213.3	213.5
am,	213.5	213.6
that	213.6	214.6
you	214.6	215.0
saw	215.0	215.2
me	215.2	215.4
first.	215.4	215.6
I	215.6	218.0
just,	218.0	218.2
I	218.2	218.6
don't	218.6	218.8
think	218.8	219.1
we	219.1	219.3
should	219.3	219.3
be	219.3	219.5
pranking	219.5	220.4
anyting.	220.4	221.1
Treat	222.7	223.4
you	223.4	223.5
real	223.5	223.7
nice.	223.7	224.2
No	235.0	235.4
honey.	235.4	236.0
Listen	236.0	236.2
I	236.2	236.5
think	236.5	236.8
it's	236.8	236.9
a	236.9	236.9
great	236.9	237.1
idea	237.1	237.5
to	237.5	238.0
become	238.0	238.5
friends	238.5	238.8
with	238.8	239.0
someone	239.0	239.2
before	239.2	239.5
you	239.5	239.7
date	239.7	240.0
them,	240.0	240.2
but	240.2	240.6
I	240.6	240.7
think	240.7	240.8
the	240.8	241.0
way	241.0	241.2
you	241.2	241.3
do	241.3	241.6
it	241.6	241.6
is	241.6	241.8
you	241.8	242.0
know,	242.0	242.2
you	242.2	242.2
meet	242.2	242.6
someone	242.6	243.0
become	243.0	243.6
their	243.6	243.7
friend,	243.7	244.0
build	244.0	245.2
the	245.2	245.3
foundation,	245.3	246.2
and	246.2	246.7
ask	246.7	247.0
him	247.0	247.0
out	247.0	247.2
on	247.2	247.3
a	247.3	247.4
date.	247.4	247.7
Don't	247.7	248.8
hit	248.8	249.1
on	249.1	249.2
your	249.2	249.3
existing	249.3	249.6
friends,	249.6	250.5
will	250.5	253.3
that	253.3	253.5
take	253.5	253.7
longer	253.7	254.0
Yeah.	255.9	256.3
Yeah,	256.3	256.3
but	256.3	258.4
once	258.4	258.7
you	258.7	258.8
find	258.8	259.2
it,	259.2	259.3
What	260.7	261.3
the	261.3	261.5
wait?	261.5	261.8
But	263.3	264.7
I	264.7	264.7
understand.	264.7	265.1
Man,	267.6	268.2
I	268.2	268.3
wish	268.3	268.4
your	268.4	268.6
selfie	268.6	268.9
be	268.9	269.1
first.	269.1	269.5

brought	283.1	283.4
reinforcements.	283.4	284.1
Trailer	289.9	290.5

bought	290.7	290.9
Chandler,	290.9	291.5
the	291.5	291.7
next	291.7	292.0
best	292.0	292.2

You	295.0	295.3
know,	295.3	295.4
I	295.4	295.4
would	295.4	295.6
be	295.6	295.7
offended	295.7	296.1
but	296.1	296.2
Monica	296.2	297.0
is	297.0	297.1
freakishly	297.1	297.6
Strong's.	297.6	298.1
I	299.7	300.2
drew	300.2	300.5
a	300.5	300.6
sketch	300.6	300.9
of	300.9	301.1
how	301.1	301.3
we're	301.3	301.5
going	301.5	301.6
to	301.6	301.6
do	301.6	301.8
it.	301.8	302.0
Okay,	302.0	302.1
that's	302.1	303.5
you,	303.5	303.7
that's	303.7	304.7
the	304.7	305.0
couch.	305.0	305.4
What's	307.7	308.0
that?	308.0	308.3
That's	308.3	309.1
me.	309.1	309.5
Wow.	311.4	311.9
Certainly	314.9	315.5
think	315.5	315.7
a	315.7	315.8
lot	315.8	316.0
of	316.0	316.1
yourself.	316.1	316.3
Oh,	318.8	319.3
that's,	319.3	319.5
that's	319.5	319.7
my	319.7	320.0
arm.	320.0	320.5
Oh,	325.1	325.5
I	325.5	325.7
see.	325.7	325.9
I	325.9	326.0
thought	326.0	326.2
you	326.2	326.3
just	326.3	326.5
really,	326.5	326.9
really	326.9	327.0
like	327.0	327.4
your	327.4	327.5
new	327.5	327.7
couch.	327.7	328.1
Follow	333.1	333.6
My	333.6	333.7
Lead.	333.7	334.2
All	339.9	340.2
right.	340.2	340.4
All	344.0	344.2
right.	344.2	344.5
I	382.7	383.5
don't	383.5	383.7
think	383.7	383.8
it's	383.8	383.9
going	383.9	383.9
to	383.9	384.1
Pivot	384.1	384.6
anymore,	384.6	385.1
you	385.1	385.4
think?	385.4	385.8
Let's	388.9	389.6
see,	389.6	389.7
let's	389.7	390.1
bring	390.1	390.7
it	390.7	390.8
back	390.8	391.1
down	391.1	391.3
and	391.3	391.6
try	391.6	391.9
again.	391.9	392.2
Okay,	400.8	401.2
yeah,	401.2	401.4
he's	401.4	401.8
good	401.8	401.9
stuff	401.9	402.3
now.	402.3	402.5
Trampolines,	404.9	405.9
that	405.9	405.9
didn't	405.9	406.3
work.	406.3	406.7
What	412.4	413.1
did	413.1	413.3
you	413.3	413.4
mean	413.4	413.5
when	413.5	413.7
you	413.7	413.8
said,	413.8	413.9
But	421.5	421.9
I	421.9	422.0
cannot	422.0	422.4
figure	422.4	422.7
this	422.7	423.0
out.	423.0	423.1
Yeah,	423.1	424.6
because	424.6	424.8
it's	424.8	425.0
not	425.0	425.2
1985.	425.2	426.4
You	428.7	429.1
guys,	429.1	429.6
guess	429.6	430.3
what?	430.3	430.4
The	430.4	432.0

What	432.3	433.0
what	433.0	433.3
do	433.3	433.6
you	433.6	433.6
mean	433.6	433.7
using	433.7	435.1
his	435.1	435.3
badge?	435.3	435.6
And	435.6	435.8
he	435.8	435.9
tried	435.9	436.1
to	436.1	436.2
bust	436.2	436.5
me.	436.5	436.7
How	439.7	440.0
far	440.0	440.2
did	440.2	440.3
he	440.3	440.5
chase?	440.5	440.7
You	440.7	440.8
didn't	440.8	442.0
really,	442.0	442.2
he	442.2	442.4
just	442.4	442.4
he	442.4	442.7
picked	442.7	443.0
up	443.0	443.1
his	443.1	443.1
badge	443.1	443.6
and	443.6	443.6
stood	443.6	444.3
there.	444.3	444.4
But	445.6	446.0
maybe	446.0	446.2
