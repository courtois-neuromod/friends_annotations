What	2.6	3.0
do	3.0	3.2
I	3.2	3.3
do	3.3	3.5
now?	3.5	3.8
When	3.8	4.3
you	4.3	4.5
play	4.5	4.7
hard	4.7	5.0
to	5.0	5.1
get	5.1	5.2
she	7.1	7.4
already	7.4	7.9
lives	7.9	8.5
in	8.5	8.7
London.	8.7	9.1
You	11.2	11.6

Tokyo?	11.9	12.2
Forget	14.6	16.0
it.	16.0	16.2
Okay,	16.2	16.6
forget	16.6	17.0
it.	17.0	17.1
You	17.1	17.4
told	17.4	17.6
her	17.6	17.7
you	17.7	17.8
love	17.8	18.0
her.	18.0	18.2
It's	18.2	18.6

Okay.	31.0	31.5
Good	33.7	34.1
one	34.1	34.3
is	34.3	36.9
not	36.9	37.2
over	37.2	37.5
because	37.5	37.8
she's	37.8	38.0
going	38.0	38.1
to	38.1	38.2
call	38.2	38.6
you	38.6	38.9

you	39.2	39.4
she	39.4	39.6
loves	39.6	39.7
you.	39.7	40.0
And	40.0	40.5
the	40.5	40.6
reason	40.6	40.8
why	40.8	40.9
she	40.9	41.0
couldn't	41.0	41.3
because	41.3	41.9
her	41.9	42.0
feelings	42.0	42.4
were	42.4	42.5
so	42.5	42.5
strong,	42.5	42.8
that	42.8	43.2
it	43.2	43.3
scared	43.3	43.8
her	43.8	43.9
and	43.9	44.3
you	44.3	44.5
go	44.5	44.6
home,	44.6	44.7
and	44.7	44.9
you	44.9	45.0
wait	45.0	45.2
for	45.2	45.4
her	45.4	45.5
to	45.5	45.7
call	45.7	46.3
you	46.3	46.5
from	46.5	46.7
the	46.7	46.8
plane,	46.8	47.3
come	47.3	48.0
on	48.0	48.1
and	48.1	48.3
go	48.3	48.4
go.	48.4	48.7
But	48.7	50.4
if	50.4	50.5
she	50.5	50.7
doesn't	50.7	51.0
call,	51.0	51.3
it	51.3	51.6
is	51.6	51.8
definitely	51.8	52.6
over	52.6	53.1
eventually.	53.1	55.0
I	55.0	55.8
call	55.8	56.2
her	56.2	56.4
and	56.4	56.6
see	56.6	57.3
what's	57.3	57.5
going	57.5	57.6
on	57.6	57.8
and	57.8	58.6
she	58.6	59.4
says,	59.4	60.0
she'll	60.0	60.2
call	60.2	60.5
me	60.5	60.6
back,	60.6	60.8
but	60.8	61.2
then	61.2	61.5
she	61.5	61.7
doesn't	61.7	62.2
then	62.2	63.1
it's	63.1	63.8
over.	63.8	64.7
Way	66.3	66.7
to	66.7	66.8
be	66.8	66.9
strong,	66.9	67.4
man.	67.4	67.5
Listen,	77.8	79.6
can	79.6	79.7
we	79.7	79.7
watch	79.7	80.1
cartoons	80.1	80.6
on	80.6	80.7
your	80.7	80.8

We	81.1	81.8
need	81.8	81.9

We	83.2	84.5
spent	84.5	84.7
the	84.7	84.7
last	84.7	84.8
two	84.8	85.0
hours,	85.0	85.3
watching	85.3	85.6

in	86.4	86.6
again,	86.6	87.0
So	90.3	90.6
why	90.6	90.8
don't	90.8	90.9
you	90.9	91.0
just	91.0	91.1
turn	91.1	91.6
it	91.6	91.7
off?	91.7	92.0
Because	92.0	92.4
then	92.4	92.7
we'd	92.7	92.8
be	92.8	92.9
the	92.9	93.1

Hello.	168.6	169.1
Emily	169.1	172.5
High.	172.5	172.9
How	174.3	176.5
was	176.5	177.0
your	177.0	177.2
flight?	177.2	177.4
It	178.4	178.6
was	178.6	179.1
Dreadful.	179.1	179.3
I	179.3	180.4
felt	180.4	180.9
terrible	180.9	181.1
about	181.1	181.5
how	181.5	182.0
I	182.0	182.2
acted	182.2	182.3
when	182.3	182.8
you	182.8	182.9
said	182.9	183.2
those	183.2	183.5
wonderful	183.5	184.0
things.	184.0	184.0
I'm	188.7	189.0
just	189.0	189.2
glad	189.2	189.3
you	189.3	189.6
called.	189.6	190.1
Someone	196.4	197.9
else.	197.9	198.2
Does	203.2	203.5
that	203.5	203.7
mean	203.7	203.9
the	203.9	204.0
same	204.0	204.2
thing	204.2	204.4
in	204.4	204.7
England?	204.7	205.1
As	205.1	205.3
it	205.3	205.4
doesn't	205.4	205.8
America?	205.8	206.4
But	210.8	211.1
she	211.1	211.3
wants	211.3	211.9
me	211.9	212.0
or	212.0	212.6
this	212.6	212.8
Colin	212.8	213.6
guy	213.6	213.9
so	213.9	214.5
I	214.5	214.6
told	214.6	214.8
her	214.8	214.9
when	214.9	215.1
she	215.1	215.2
figures,	215.2	215.6
it	215.6	215.7
out,	215.7	215.8
give	215.8	216.2
me	216.2	216.2
a	216.2	216.4
call.	216.4	216.4
Maybe	216.4	216.9
I'll	216.9	217.2
still	217.2	217.5
be	217.5	217.6
around.	217.6	217.8
So	217.8	219.1
I	219.1	219.3
know	219.3	219.6
when	219.6	220.0
you	220.0	220.1
say	220.1	220.3
still	220.3	220.6
around,	220.6	221.1
you	221.1	221.2
mean	221.2	221.3
still	221.3	221.7
around.	221.7	221.9
Like,	221.9	222.1
you	222.1	222.2
might	222.2	222.3
be	222.3	222.4
in	222.4	222.5
a	222.5	222.5
relationship	222.5	222.7
or	222.7	223.3
still	223.3	223.7
around	223.7	223.8
like	223.8	224.2
you	224.2	224.3
might	224.3	224.5
have	224.5	224.5
died	224.5	225.1
waiting	225.1	225.4
for	225.4	225.6
the	225.6	225.7
phone	225.7	225.8
to	225.8	226.0
ring.	226.0	226.1
It	228.2	228.8
was	228.8	229.0
so	229.0	229.2
right,	229.2	229.8
this	229.8	230.9
isn't	230.9	231.1
how	231.1	231.3
it	231.3	231.4
was	231.4	231.4
supposed	231.4	231.8
to	231.8	231.9
go.	231.9	232.2
I	232.2	232.5
mean,	232.5	232.5
another	232.5	233.3
guy,	233.3	233.5
Of	236.7	237.1
course.	237.1	237.5
Even	238.3	240.2
more	240.2	240.4
perfect.	240.4	240.8
Have	242.9	243.2
to	243.2	243.3
prove	243.3	243.7
your	243.7	244.0
love.	244.0	244.1
I'm	244.1	245.0
not	245.0	245.1
proving	245.1	245.8
anything.	245.8	246.0
I'm	246.0	247.5
done	247.5	247.8
listening	247.8	248.1
to	248.1	248.5
you.	248.5	248.7
I	248.7	249.1
had	249.1	249.3
to	249.3	249.4
let	249.4	249.5
you	249.5	249.6
talk	249.6	249.8
me	249.8	250.0
into	250.0	250.0
going	250.0	250.2
to	250.2	250.5
the	250.5	250.6
airport	250.6	251.0
in	251.0	251.3
the	251.3	251.4
first	251.4	251.7
place.	251.7	252.1
I	252.1	252.3
never	252.3	252.5
went	252.5	252.7
put	252.7	252.9
my	252.9	253.0
fist	253.0	253.3
through	253.3	253.4
the	253.4	253.6
wall.	253.6	253.7
You	253.7	254.6
put	254.6	254.7
your	254.7	254.8
fist	254.8	255.2
through	255.2	255.2
the	255.2	255.4
wall.	255.4	255.5
Know	255.5	256.3
I	256.3	256.4
miss	256.4	256.6
and	256.6	256.8
hit	256.8	256.9
the	256.9	257.1
door.	257.1	257.4
But	259.8	260.2
it	260.2	260.3
opened	260.3	260.7
really	260.7	261.1
hard.	261.1	261.7
You	261.7	263.9

go	266.6	266.8
find	266.8	267.0
for	267.0	267.2
her.	267.2	267.3
That	267.3	268.9
makes	268.9	269.0
sense,	269.0	269.5
didn't	269.5	271.9
say	271.9	272.1
it	272.1	272.2
back,	272.2	272.4
then	272.4	273.2
she	273.2	273.5
called	273.5	274.0
you	274.0	274.1
and	274.1	274.2

there	274.5	274.6
was	274.6	274.7
another	274.7	274.9

I	293.2	293.7
see	293.7	294.1

the	296.3	296.4
same	296.4	296.6
thing.	296.6	296.7
Like	303.5	304.8
a	304.8	304.9

be	308.0	308.2
you	308.2	308.3
and	308.3	308.5

Really	318.0	318.6
come	318.6	319.1

Don't	321.9	322.4
let	322.4	322.5

go	322.6	322.7
without	322.7	322.9

I'm	326.5	326.6
going	326.6	326.7
to	326.7	326.9
do	326.9	327.1
it.	327.1	327.3
I'm	327.3	328.1
going	328.1	328.3

Good	331.3	332.1

I	346.2	347.8
did	347.8	348.0
it.	348.0	348.2
I	348.2	348.6
did	348.6	348.7
it.	348.7	349.0
I	349.0	349.1
figured	349.1	349.3
out	349.3	349.5
a	349.5	349.7
way	349.7	349.7
to	349.7	349.9
make	349.9	350.0
money,	350.0	350.3
so	350.3	350.8
I	350.8	351.4
can	351.4	351.5
open	351.5	351.7
up	351.7	351.9
my	351.9	352.0
own.	352.0	352.2
Massage	352.2	352.5
place	352.5	352.9
in	352.9	353.0
Frank's	353.0	353.3
going	353.3	353.4
to	353.4	353.6
help	353.6	353.8
me	353.8	353.9
and	353.9	354.6
we	354.6	355.0
can	355.0	355.1
work	355.1	355.2
around	355.2	355.5
his	355.5	355.8
schedule	355.8	356.2
so	356.2	356.4
he	356.4	356.5
doesn't	356.5	356.7
have	356.7	356.8
to	356.8	357.0
quit	357.0	357.3
school.	357.3	357.5
That	360.6	361.0
sounds	361.0	361.2
great	361.2	361.4
but	361.4	361.5
her	361.5	361.6
even	361.6	361.9
be	361.9	362.0
able	362.0	362.0
to	362.0	362.1
afford	362.1	362.2
it.	362.2	362.9
We	362.9	363.1
were	363.1	363.3
walking	363.3	363.5
on	363.5	363.7
the	363.7	363.7
street	363.7	364.1
that	364.1	364.6
you	364.6	365.2
guys	365.2	365.5
use	365.5	365.7
for	365.7	365.8
catering	365.8	366.3
and	366.3	366.5
we	366.5	366.6
realized	366.6	367.2
You	368.7	371.0
know	371.0	371.1
how	371.1	371.3
people	371.3	371.5
need	371.5	371.9
Transportation,	371.9	372.3
but	372.3	372.9
they	372.9	373.0
also	373.0	373.4
need	373.4	373.7
massages	373.7	374.7
to	374.7	374.8
relax.	374.8	375.4
So	375.4	375.5
I	375.5	375.6
just	375.6	375.8
figured	375.8	376.0
we	376.0	376.3
can	376.3	376.4
combine	376.4	376.8
the	376.8	377.0
two.	377.0	377.3
Okay.	377.3	377.9
I	377.9	378.0
give	378.0	378.3
the	378.3	378.4
massages	378.4	379.0
and	379.0	379.3
Frank	379.3	379.6
drives,	379.6	380.2
I	380.2	380.5
can	380.5	380.7
fix	380.7	380.9
up	380.9	381.1
the	381.1	381.2
van	381.2	381.5
for	381.5	381.7
the	381.7	382.0
table	382.0	382.4
in	382.4	382.5
the	382.5	382.6
back.	382.6	382.9
And	382.9	383.0
you	383.0	383.1
know	383.1	383.2
what?	383.2	383.3
I	383.3	383.4
don't	383.4	383.6
place	383.6	384.9

no	385.1	385.3
one	385.3	385.4

ever	385.6	385.8
get	385.8	385.9
out	385.9	386.1
of	386.1	386.2
a	386.2	386.3

Found	389.6	389.9
