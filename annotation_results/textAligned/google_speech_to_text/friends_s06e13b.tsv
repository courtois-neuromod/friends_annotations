you	29.4	29.8
should	29.8	29.8
maybe	29.8	30.4
know.	30.4	30.5
Well,	30.5	31.1
it	31.1	31.2
better	31.2	31.4
not	31.4	31.6
be	31.6	31.8
about	31.8	32.0
the	32.0	32.2
apartment	32.2	32.7
pants	32.7	33.1
because	33.1	33.2

the	34.0	34.0
idea	34.0	34.2
to	34.2	34.5
my	34.5	34.7
boss	34.7	35.0

little	45.4	45.5
spark	45.5	46.4
between	46.4	46.5
them.	46.5	46.7
But	46.7	47.9

nothing	49.5	49.8
but	49.8	50.6
I	50.6	50.7
just	50.7	50.9
want	50.9	51.1
to	51.1	51.1
warn	51.1	51.4
you	51.4	51.5
that	51.5	51.9
there	51.9	52.2
might	52.2	52.3
be	52.3	52.7
something	52.7	53.2
there	53.2	53.3
with	53.3	54.3
Ross	54.3	54.5
