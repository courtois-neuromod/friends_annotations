Hey,	277.9	278.2
I	278.2	278.3
got	278.3	278.5
a	278.5	278.5
question	278.5	278.6
if	278.6	279.7
you	279.7	279.7
had	279.7	280.0
to	280.0	280.1

You	297.0	298.8

Do	304.3	304.7
Barracuda.	304.7	305.3
It	305.3	305.4
was	305.4	305.6
the	305.6	305.6
first	305.6	305.9
song	305.9	306.1
I	306.1	306.3
learned	306.3	306.4
to	306.4	306.6
play	306.6	306.8
on	306.8	306.9
the	306.9	307.0
keyboard.	307.0	307.2
So	309.2	309.6
you	309.6	309.7
heard	309.7	309.9
it,	309.9	310.2
you	310.2	311.2
repeated	311.2	311.6
it	311.6	311.7
so	311.7	312.6
that	312.6	312.7
must	312.7	312.9
mean	312.9	313.0
you	313.0	313.8
wrote	313.8	314.0
it	314.0	314.3
you	314.3	317.7

You	324.8	325.6
didn't	325.6	325.8
get	325.8	326.1
it.	326.1	326.2
The	326.2	327.0
doctor	327.0	327.4

Can't	331.4	331.5
write	331.5	331.8
a	331.8	331.9
prescription.	331.9	332.2
You	335.5	336.1
are	336.1	336.3
not	336.3	336.6
allowed	336.6	336.7
to	336.7	337.0
laugh	337.0	337.2
at	337.2	337.4
my	337.4	337.6
joke,	337.6	338.1
your	338.1	339.8
joke,	339.8	340.3
what	340.3	341.2
I	341.2	341.2
think	341.2	341.5
would	341.5	342.9
disagree,	342.9	343.3
which	343.3	344.3
is	344.3	344.4
why	344.4	344.7
