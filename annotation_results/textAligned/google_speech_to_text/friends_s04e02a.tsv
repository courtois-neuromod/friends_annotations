Back	471.2	471.7
then,	471.7	471.9
I	471.9	472.1

I	482.7	483.8
never	483.8	484.0
let	484.0	484.3
her	484.3	484.5

night	504.4	504.7
but	504.7	504.9
I	504.9	505.6
don't	505.6	505.8
think	505.8	505.9
any	505.9	506.1
of	506.1	506.2

Trying	518.8	519.1
to	519.1	519.2
get	519.2	519.3
away	519.3	519.5
just	519.5	520.8

when	520.9	521.2
she	521.2	521.3
was	521.3	521.4
alive.	521.4	521.5
How	524.2	525.0
