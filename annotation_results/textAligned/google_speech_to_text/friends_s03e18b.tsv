better	32.6	32.9
when	32.9	33.3
it's	33.3	33.5

municipal	425.4	426.0
bonds	426.0	426.4

hard	584.7	584.7
to	584.7	584.9
hear	584.9	585.0
but	585.0	585.4
it	585.4	585.7
would	585.7	586.0
have	586.0	586.0
been	586.0	586.2
wrong	586.2	586.4
to	586.4	586.6
go	586.6	586.8
through	586.8	587.1
with	587.1	587.3
it.	587.3	587.4
I	587.4	587.5
was	587.5	588.4
being	588.4	588.6
selfish	588.6	589.1
even	589.1	590.3
though	590.3	590.5
we	590.5	590.7
we	590.7	591.7
want	591.7	592.0
the	592.0	592.1
same	592.1	592.3
things	592.3	592.7
right	592.7	593.0
now	593.0	593.1
in	593.1	593.6
the	593.6	593.8
future	593.8	594.2
We	595.3	595.7
may	595.7	595.8
not.	595.8	596.1
Is	597.6	598.1
that	598.1	598.2
it?	598.2	598.3
Is	598.3	598.5
that	598.5	598.6
what	598.6	598.8
it	598.8	598.9
is?	598.9	599.0
Not	599.0	601.3
just	601.3	601.4
that	601.4	601.8
Even	605.4	605.9
though	605.9	606.1
we	606.1	607.5
love	607.5	607.8
each	607.8	608.0
other	608.0	608.1
as	608.1	608.6
much	608.6	608.9
as	608.9	609.4
we	609.4	609.5
do.	609.5	609.9
Nonetheless.	611.4	612.1
