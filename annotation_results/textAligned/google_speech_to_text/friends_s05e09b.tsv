Apparently	73.4	73.9

call	74.5	74.8
you	74.8	75.0
mental.	75.0	76.1
You	76.1	85.8

This	86.9	87.2
is	87.2	87.3
so	87.3	87.5
silly.	87.5	87.8
This	87.8	89.5
is	89.5	89.6
all	89.6	89.9
just	89.9	90.0
because	90.0	90.7
of	90.7	90.8

an	101.1	101.6
extra	101.6	102.0

of	102.3	102.6
gravy	102.6	103.0

it	105.2	105.3
the	105.3	105.4
moist	105.4	105.9

Anyway,	106.0	108.0

the	109.5	109.5

You	120.8	121.2
ate	121.2	121.4
my	121.4	121.5
sandwich.	121.5	122.0
Did	128.8	129.2
you	129.2	129.3
confuse	129.3	129.8
it	129.8	130.3
with	130.3	130.6
your	130.6	130.9
own	130.9	131.1
turkey	131.1	132.0
sandwich	132.0	132.6
with	132.6	132.7
a	132.7	132.9
moist	132.9	133.3
maker?	133.3	133.5
No.	135.2	135.6
Do	135.6	136.3
you	136.3	136.3
perhaps	136.3	136.6
remember	136.6	137.1
seeing	137.1	138.7
a	138.7	139.3
note	139.3	139.8
on	139.8	140.6
top	140.6	140.7
of	140.7	141.2
it?	141.2	141.4
There	141.4	142.1
may	142.1	142.2
have	142.2	142.3
been	142.3	142.4
a	142.4	142.7
joke	142.7	143.3
or	143.3	143.6
some	143.6	145.7
kind	145.7	146.1
it	146.1	147.6
was	147.6	147.7
Sandwich.	149.0	149.8
Knock	149.8	151.3
knock,	151.3	151.6
down	151.6	152.1
in	152.1	153.4
the	153.4	155.3
trash.	155.3	155.7
But	160.1	160.4
it	160.4	160.5
was	160.5	160.6
quite	160.6	160.9
large,	160.9	161.1
most	161.1	163.1
of	163.1	163.2
it	163.2	163.3
away	163.3	163.4
through	163.4	166.0
my	166.0	166.5
sandwich.	166.5	167.4
My	167.4	169.7
sandwich.	169.7	171.1
Well,	175.9	180.8
I	180.8	180.9
was	180.9	181.1
going	181.1	181.3
to	181.3	181.5
but	181.5	181.7
I	181.7	182.0
accidentally	182.0	183.0
read	183.0	183.3
something	183.3	183.6
else.	183.6	184.0
No,	187.9	190.4
you	190.4	190.6
should	190.6	190.8
have	190.8	190.8
read	190.8	191.1
it	191.1	191.1
yourself.	191.1	191.8
Fine.	195.6	196.3
Okay,	197.7	198.3
first	198.3	200.9
of	200.9	201.0
all,	201.0	201.2
I	201.2	201.6
think	201.6	201.8
she's	201.8	202.1
a	202.1	202.2
woman.	202.2	202.4
She's	202.4	203.0
not	203.0	203.3
she's	203.3	203.7
a	203.7	203.8
cyborg.	203.8	204.1
Cyborg	207.8	208.4
a	208.4	208.9
robot.	208.9	209.0
Get	210.7	211.1
this	211.1	211.3
book	211.3	211.5
is	211.5	211.9
light	211.9	212.3
years	212.3	212.6
ahead	212.6	212.7
of	212.7	212.8
its	212.8	212.9
time.	212.9	213.1
Sorry,	215.7	216.2
I'm	216.2	216.4
late	216.4	216.6
get	216.6	217.6
started.	217.6	217.7
So	217.7	218.6
what	218.6	219.5
did	219.5	219.6
everybody	219.6	219.9
think	219.9	220.0
of	220.0	220.3
Jane	220.3	220.6
Eyre?	220.6	220.7
Rachel	221.9	222.5
and	222.5	222.6
I	222.6	222.7
were	222.7	222.8
just	222.8	223.0
discussing	223.0	223.2
it	223.2	223.7
and	223.7	223.9
she	223.9	224.1
actually	224.1	224.5
had	224.5	224.8
some	224.8	224.9
very	224.9	225.1
interesting	225.1	225.4
insights.	225.4	226.4
I'll	228.0	228.4
go	228.4	228.6
ahead,	228.6	228.7
Rachel.	228.7	229.3
When	229.3	235.9
reading	235.9	236.2
Jane	236.2	236.5
Eyre,	236.5	236.6
was	236.6	237.5
how	237.5	238.0
the	238.0	238.1
book	238.1	238.5
was.	238.5	238.7
So	238.7	239.1
ahead	239.1	239.7
of	239.7	239.8
time.	239.8	240.4
If	240.4	241.3
you're	241.3	241.4
talking	241.4	241.7
about	241.7	241.8
feminism,	241.8	242.5
I	242.5	243.5
think	243.5	243.7
you're	243.7	243.9
right.	243.9	244.1
Yeah,	246.4	246.9
well	246.9	247.3
feminism	247.3	248.0
yes	248.0	248.4
but	248.4	248.7
also	248.7	248.8
the	248.8	249.3
robots.	249.3	249.9
Since	257.0	258.8
that	258.8	258.9
video,	258.9	259.1
camera	259.1	259.5
thing	259.5	259.8
didn't	259.8	260.1
work	260.1	260.2
out.	260.2	260.4
I	262.4	262.7
thought	262.7	263.0
that	263.0	263.1
I	263.1	263.2
would	263.2	263.3
give	263.3	263.5
you	263.5	263.6
two	263.6	263.9
a	263.9	264.2
little	264.2	264.3
preview.	264.3	265.8
You're	267.7	268.2
naked	268.2	268.4
in	268.4	268.7
that	268.7	268.7
picture.	268.7	269.0
I	269.0	269.6
know.	269.6	269.9
Ross.	282.0	282.6
Monica.	287.1	287.8
Are	289.7	290.0
you	290.0	290.2
okay?	290.2	290.5
I'm	290.5	291.2
fine.	291.2	291.4
I	291.4	292.5
saw	292.5	292.8
a	292.8	292.9
psychiatrist	292.9	293.2
at	293.2	293.9
work	293.9	294.2
today.	294.2	294.4
Why?	295.7	296.1
But	296.1	297.1
I	297.1	297.2
kind	297.2	297.3
of	297.3	297.5
my	297.5	297.7
rage.	297.7	298.1
As	299.9	300.1
you	300.1	300.2
find	300.2	300.4
me,	300.4	300.6
say	300.6	300.9
right	300.9	301.1
now	301.1	301.3
is	301.3	301.7
out	301.7	301.9
of	301.9	302.0
control.	302.0	302.2
He	304.5	304.7
gave	304.7	305.0
me	305.0	305.0
a	305.0	305.2
pill	305.2	305.5
for	305.5	305.8
it.	305.8	306.0
What	309.8	310.2
was	310.2	310.4
the	310.4	310.5
psychiatrist?	310.5	311.4
Told	311.4	311.5
me	311.5	311.8
that	311.8	311.9
I	311.9	312.0
had	312.0	312.2
to	312.2	312.3
take	312.3	312.5
a	312.5	312.7
leave	312.7	312.9
of	312.9	313.0
absence	313.0	313.2
because	313.2	313.8
I	313.8	314.1
yelled	314.1	314.5
at	314.5	314.5
my	314.5	314.7
boss	314.7	315.2
I	315.2	315.3
started	315.3	315.7
to	315.7	315.8
get	315.8	315.9
worked	315.9	316.5
up	316.5	316.5
again.	316.5	316.8
So	317.8	318.4
he	318.4	318.6
offered	318.6	318.7
me	318.7	319.0
a	319.0	319.1
tranquilizer.	319.1	319.5
I	321.0	321.3
thought	321.3	321.6
it	321.6	321.7
was	321.7	321.8
a	321.8	321.9
good	321.9	322.1
idea,	322.1	322.2
so	322.2	323.8
I	323.8	323.9
took	323.9	324.1
it.	324.1	324.4
They're	327.9	328.3
making	328.3	328.4
you	328.4	328.6
take	328.6	328.9
time	328.9	329.1
off	329.1	329.2
work	329.2	329.5
and	329.5	330.4
you're	330.4	330.6
okay	330.6	330.8
with	330.8	331.0
that.	331.0	331.1
I	331.1	337.7
definitely	337.7	337.9
don't	337.9	338.4
care	338.4	338.7
about	338.7	338.9
my	338.9	339.1
sandwich.	339.1	339.7
Do	342.5	342.8
you	342.8	343.0
know	343.0	343.2
I	343.2	343.2
hate	343.2	343.4
it	343.4	343.5
when	343.5	343.7
they	343.7	343.8
make	343.8	343.8
me.	343.8	344.1
See	344.1	344.2
the	344.2	344.3
shrink	344.3	344.5
of	344.5	344.7
my	344.7	344.8
office	344.8	345.2
and	345.2	345.6
I	345.6	345.7
was	345.7	345.8
always	345.8	346.0
like	346.0	346.2
what?	346.2	346.4
Maybe	346.4	347.0
your	347.0	347.2
colleagues	347.2	347.7
would	347.7	347.8
like,	347.8	348.0
you	348.0	348.1
better,	348.1	348.3
if	348.3	348.6
you	348.6	348.8
like	348.8	349.1
yourself	349.1	349.7
better	349.7	349.7
that	349.7	351.2
you	351.2	352.5
do	352.5	352.7
I	352.7	352.8
know?	352.8	353.1
Just	356.8	357.4
so	357.4	357.5
embarrassing.	357.5	357.8
I	357.8	358.4
can't	358.4	358.6
believe	358.6	358.7
you.	358.7	358.8
Let	358.8	359.1
me	359.1	359.1
go	359.1	359.3
on	359.3	359.4
and	359.4	359.7
on	359.7	359.8
and	359.8	360.0
on	360.0	360.2
like	360.2	360.5
that,	360.5	360.6
I'm	360.6	361.5
sorry.	361.5	361.7
It	365.0	365.3
was	365.3	365.5
just	365.5	365.7
so	365.7	365.9
funny	365.9	366.1
when	366.1	366.4
you	366.4	366.5
started	366.5	366.9
comparing	366.9	367.3
Jane	367.3	367.6
Eyre	367.6	367.7
in	367.7	367.8
a	367.8	367.9
Robocop.	367.9	368.6
That	370.8	371.3
was	371.3	371.5
not	371.5	371.9
funny.	371.9	372.8
That's	374.2	374.5
okay.	374.5	374.8
You	374.8	375.1
were	375.1	375.2
taking	375.2	375.6
the	375.6	375.6
class.	375.6	375.9
Seriously,	375.9	376.7
what	376.7	378.4
is	378.4	378.5
the	378.5	378.6
big	378.6	378.8
deal?	378.8	379.0
I	379.0	379.5
thought	379.5	379.6
this	379.6	379.8
was	379.8	379.9
going	379.9	380.0
to	380.0	380.1
be	380.1	380.2
something	380.2	380.5
we	380.5	380.9
could	380.9	381.1
do	381.1	381.3
together.	381.3	381.4
You	381.4	382.0
know.	382.0	382.1
I	382.1	382.4
thought	382.4	382.5
it	382.5	382.7
would	382.7	382.8
be	382.8	382.9
fun,	382.9	383.4
but	383.4	384.1
we	384.1	384.3
have	384.3	384.4
fun	384.4	384.6
is	384.6	384.8
good,	384.8	385.1
but,	385.1	385.5
you	385.5	385.7
know,	385.7	385.8
I	385.8	386.0
also	386.0	386.3
wanted	386.3	386.7
to	386.7	386.8
learn.	386.8	387.0
Your	387.0	388.0
people	388.0	388.3
are	388.3	388.4
always	388.4	388.6
talking	388.6	388.8
about	388.8	389.1
what	389.1	389.3
they	389.3	389.4
learned	389.4	389.7
in	389.7	389.8
high	389.8	390.0
school	390.0	390.3
and	390.3	390.4
I	390.4	390.6
never	390.6	390.7
went	390.7	390.9
to	390.9	391.0
high	391.0	391.2
school.	391.2	391.3
oh,	394.3	395.0
so	395.0	395.3
you	395.3	395.5
really	395.5	395.9
wanted	395.9	396.3
to	396.3	396.4
learn	396.4	396.7
Yeah,	399.3	399.7

Have	401.0	401.1
Fun.	401.1	401.2
you	403.5	403.9
don't	403.9	404.0
you	404.0	404.1
should	404.1	404.2
go	404.2	404.4
with	404.4	404.7
Monica,	408.6	409.3

a	466.4	466.5
Do	469.1	469.5
you	469.5	469.6

I'm	470.0	470.2

Okay.	471.3	471.7
It's	471.7	472.4
just	472.4	472.5

kind	474.2	474.7
of	474.7	475.1
look.	475.1	476.6

explain	477.7	477.8
this.	477.8	478.3
Thank	478.3	479.3
you.	479.3	479.4
Joey	480.5	481.6

addict.	482.1	482.5
I	492.9	493.5
am	493.5	493.7
not	493.7	494.0
a	494.0	494.1
sex	494.1	494.5

Stop.	499.3	499.9
No,	499.9	500.5
it	500.5	500.7
isn't.	500.7	501.0
No,	501.0	501.4
it's	501.4	501.7
not	501.7	501.9
because	501.9	502.4
you	502.4	502.5
could	502.5	502.6
also	502.6	502.9
explain	502.9	503.5
it	503.5	504.0
with	504.0	504.2
a	504.2	504.3
drill.	504.3	504.6
But	505.7	506.2
what	506.2	506.4
is	506.4	506.5
the	506.5	506.7
truth?	506.7	507.2
I	514.9	515.2
slept	515.2	516.1
with	516.1	516.2
Monica.	516.2	516.6
Well,	523.1	523.5
let's	523.5	523.8
let's	523.8	525.1
see	525.1	525.2
what	525.2	525.4
everybody	525.4	525.8
thinks	525.8	525.8
of	525.8	526.1
that.	526.1	526.3
Oh	529.3	530.5
no.	530.5	530.7
You	532.4	532.7
slept	532.7	533.0
with	533.0	533.2
my	533.2	533.3
sister?	533.3	533.5
Yes,	536.1	536.5
but	536.5	537.1
it	537.1	537.2
was,	537.2	537.5
we	537.5	537.7
just	537.7	537.7
did	537.7	538.0
it	538.0	538.1
once	538.1	538.5
in	538.5	539.1
London.	539.1	539.4
This	539.4	540.1
is	540.1	540.3
not	540.3	540.5
good	540.5	540.8
for	540.8	541.0
my	541.0	541.1
rage.	541.1	541.7
Is	547.7	548.0
this	548.0	548.2
true?	548.2	548.5
It's	548.5	549.4
true.	549.4	549.5
How	550.9	551.3
else	551.3	551.5
would	551.5	551.6

all	551.8	552.2
the	552.2	552.3
weird	552.3	552.8
stuff	552.8	552.9
that's	552.9	553.2
been	553.2	553.4
going	553.4	553.6

Yes,	556.7	557.2
it's	557.2	557.5
true.	557.5	557.6
Okay,	559.7	560.2
but	560.2	560.4
if	560.4	560.5
it	560.5	560.6
only	560.6	560.7
happened	560.7	561.1
that	561.1	561.2
one	561.2	561.4
time,	561.4	561.7
how	561.7	561.8
can	561.8	561.9
we	561.9	562.0
found	562.0	562.2
your	562.2	562.4
underwear	562.4	562.5

our	562.9	563.0
apartment	563.0	563.4
the	563.4	563.5
other	563.5	563.6
day?	563.6	563.7
That	567.0	567.5
was	567.5	567.6
younger	567.6	567.9
where	567.9	568.1
I	568.1	568.2
was	568.2	568.4
wearing	568.4	568.8

night	569.0	569.1
in	569.1	569.8
London	569.8	569.9
by	569.9	570.7
Monica.	570.7	571.1
I	575.1	575.4
guess	575.4	575.7
I	575.7	575.8
wanted	575.8	576.1
to	576.1	576.2
keep	576.2	576.4
it.	576.4	576.5
As	578.4	578.7
a	578.7	578.8
souvenir.	578.8	579.0
God	581.8	582.8

Joe?	585.2	585.5
Are	585.5	586.1
you	586.1	586.2
sure	586.2	586.4
you're	586.4	586.6
not	586.6	586.6
just	586.6	586.7
a	586.7	587.0
sex	587.0	587.3
addict.	587.3	587.6
Know,	589.7	590.2
if	590.2	591.1

a	591.6	591.6
sex	591.6	591.9
addict	591.9	592.2
here,	592.2	592.4
it's	592.4	592.8
Monica.	592.8	593.1
She	595.7	596.1
has	596.1	596.4
been	596.4	596.5
trying	596.5	596.7
to	596.7	596.8
get	596.8	596.9
me	596.9	597.1
back	597.1	597.2
in	597.2	597.4
the	597.4	597.5
sack	597.5	597.8
of	597.8	597.9
it	597.9	598.0
since	598.0	598.1
London.	598.1	598.4
That's	600.6	601.0
why	601.0	601.2
she	601.2	601.4
gave	601.4	601.5
you	601.5	601.7
a	601.7	601.8
naked	601.8	602.0
picture	602.0	602.4
of	602.4	602.6
herself	602.6	602.9
but	602.9	603.7
my	603.7	603.8
friends.	603.8	604.3
And	606.3	606.6
the	606.6	606.7
video	606.7	606.9
camera	606.9	607.4
Monica.	607.4	609.2
I	612.5	612.8
guess	612.8	613.1
I	613.1	613.2
set	613.2	613.5
up	613.5	613.6
the	613.6	613.7
video	613.7	613.9

try	614.7	614.9
and	614.9	615.2
entice	615.2	615.5
Joey.	615.5	616.1
Sadly,	616.1	619.1
I	619.1	619.2
could	619.2	619.4
not	619.4	619.6
be	619.6	619.8
enticed.	619.8	620.4
This	623.0	623.9
has	623.9	624.1
to	624.1	624.3
stop	624.3	624.4
now.	624.4	624.9
I	624.9	628.0
know,	628.0	628.3
I	628.3	628.6
know,	628.6	628.8
I	628.8	628.9
know	628.9	628.9
I	628.9	629.7
will	629.7	630.6
and	630.6	630.9
I	630.9	631.5
would	631.5	631.6
appreciate	631.6	631.9
it	631.9	632.0
if	632.0	632.3
we	632.3	632.4
all	632.4	632.6
could	632.6	632.8
just	632.8	633.0
see	633.0	633.1
immediately	633.1	635.5
and	635.5	636.3
forever.	636.3	636.7
Okay,	638.2	638.9
that	638.9	639.9
is	639.9	640.0
if	640.0	640.7
you	640.7	640.8
can	640.8	640.8
resist	640.8	641.1
me.	641.1	641.4
I'll	643.5	643.8
give	643.8	643.9
it	643.9	644.0
my	644.0	644.1
best	644.1	644.2
shot.	644.2	644.5
Good	644.5	645.4
luck.	645.4	645.7
Unbelievable.	648.0	649.4
I	649.4	649.4

really	649.8	649.9
kept	649.9	650.6
Joey's	650.6	651.3
underwear.	651.3	652.2
Do	653.7	654.0
that.	654.0	654.5
I'm	658.7	659.1
Monica.	659.1	659.5
Disgusting.	661.6	662.4
I	664.5	664.8
stalk	664.8	665.3
guys	665.3	665.8
and	665.8	666.0
keep	666.0	666.5
their	666.5	666.7
underpants.	666.7	667.4
What	671.3	671.7
I	671.7	672.9
think	672.9	673.2
we've	673.2	673.5
all	673.5	673.7
learned	673.7	674.1
something	674.1	674.4
about	674.4	674.6
who's	674.6	674.9
disgusting	674.9	675.7
and	675.7	675.9
who's	675.9	676.1
not.	676.1	676.3
I'm	678.6	680.8
going	680.8	681.0

I'm	684.0	684.2
only	684.2	684.4
eating	684.4	684.5
the	684.5	684.7

chickens	685.4	685.7
up	685.7	685.9
for	685.9	686.1
grabs.	686.1	686.4
I	693.3	693.5
thought	693.5	693.7
you	693.7	693.8
were	693.8	693.9
making	693.9	694.1
a	694.1	694.3
good	694.3	694.5
point.	694.5	694.8
I	694.8	695.2
mean,	695.2	695.4
you	695.4	695.6
know,	695.6	695.8
so	695.8	696.2
you	696.2	696.3
got	696.3	696.4
cut	696.4	696.6
off.	696.6	696.7
What's	698.1	698.7

with	698.9	699.0
the	699.0	699.1

Monica?	699.3	699.8
I	699.8	700.2
don't	700.2	700.4
know,	700.4	700.6
I	700.6	700.7
didn't	700.7	700.9
come	700.9	701.1
with	701.1	701.3
her.	701.3	701.5
Everybody	704.9	705.7
gets	705.7	706.0
what?	706.0	706.3
I	706.3	706.9
just	706.9	707.0

Just	710.7	711.8
