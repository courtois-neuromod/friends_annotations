pressure	406.2	406.3
and	406.3	406.7
I	406.7	406.7
snapped	406.7	407.0
but	407.0	408.2
Janice	408.2	408.8
said	408.8	409.0
that	409.0	409.1
was	409.1	409.2
like	409.2	409.4
the	409.4	409.4
worst	409.4	409.6
breakup	409.6	410.2
in	410.2	410.3
history.	410.3	410.8
Anti	416.1	416.7
Salt	416.7	417.1
Lake.	417.1	417.3
Too	426.7	427.1
many	427.1	427.5
jokes.	427.5	428.2
Mark	430.5	431.1
Joey.	431.1	431.5
Nice	434.0	434.4
shoes,	434.4	434.9
huh?	434.9	435.1
He's	441.9	442.4
playing	442.4	442.7
with	442.7	442.9
my	442.9	443.0
spatula.	443.0	443.5
But	449.4	450.7
I	450.7	450.8
didn't	450.8	451.0
want	451.0	451.0
to	451.0	451.2
leave	451.2	451.4
him	451.4	451.5
alone.	451.5	451.6
All	451.6	452.4
right.	452.4	452.6
We	452.6	452.7
we	452.7	453.0
tried	453.0	453.6
our	453.6	453.7
first	453.7	454.1
fight	454.1	454.3
this	454.3	454.5
morning.	454.5	454.8
I'm	456.7	457.0
thinking	457.0	457.3
I	457.3	457.4
should	457.4	457.4
do	457.4	457.8
with	457.8	457.9
my	457.9	458.0
working	458.0	458.6
late.	458.6	458.9
I	458.9	459.1
said	459.1	459.5
some	459.5	459.7
things	459.7	459.8
that	459.8	460.2
I	460.2	460.4
didn't	460.4	460.6
mean	460.6	460.8
and	460.8	461.1
he	463.7	464.1
threw	464.1	464.4
some	464.4	464.7
feces.	464.7	465.0
Going	468.4	470.1
to	470.1	470.1
work	470.1	470.3
late.	470.3	470.5
I	470.5	470.6
can	470.6	470.8
look	470.8	470.9
in	470.9	471.1
on	471.1	471.2
him	471.2	471.3
for	471.3	471.6
you	471.6	471.7
to	471.7	472.9
be	472.9	473.0
great.	473.0	473.4
But	473.4	474.9
if	474.9	475.1
you	475.1	475.2
do,	475.2	475.4
make	475.4	475.6
sure	475.6	475.7
it	475.7	475.9
seems	475.9	476.3
like	476.3	476.5
you're	476.5	476.7
there	476.7	476.9
to	476.9	477.1
see	477.1	477.3
him,	477.3	477.8
okay?	477.8	478.2
And	478.2	478.6
you're	478.6	478.7
not	478.7	478.8
like	478.8	479.0
doing	479.0	479.2
it	479.2	479.4
as	479.4	479.5
a	479.5	479.6
favor	479.6	479.6
to	479.6	480.0
me,	480.0	480.1
okay?	480.1	481.4
But	481.4	481.7
if	481.7	481.8
he	481.8	481.9
asks,	481.9	482.5
I'm	482.5	482.6
not	482.6	482.8
going	482.8	483.2
to	483.2	483.3
lunch.	483.3	483.7
But	489.4	491.1
you	491.1	491.8
can	491.8	492.0
actually	492.0	492.2
test	492.2	492.6
this	492.6	492.7
Theory	492.7	492.9
because	492.9	493.8
today	493.8	494.2
is	494.2	494.3
particle	494.3	494.6
accelerators	494.6	495.3
are	495.3	495.4
nowhere	495.4	496.0
near	496.0	496.1
powerful	496.1	496.7
enough	496.7	496.8
to	496.8	497.0
simulate	497.0	498.1
these	498.1	498.3
conditions.	498.3	498.6
Okay.	499.9	500.3
Alright,	500.3	500.6
I	500.6	501.2
have	501.2	501.3
a	501.3	501.4
question	501.4	501.6
then.	501.6	501.9
That's	507.6	509.1
definitely	509.1	509.4
a	509.4	509.8
valid	509.8	510.3
question	510.3	510.5
and	510.5	511.6
the	511.6	512.6
answer	512.6	513.0
would	513.0	513.8
be.	513.8	513.9
Yes	513.9	515.1
I	515.1	516.4
will.	516.4	516.6
But	521.5	522.1
see,	522.1	522.8
I	522.8	523.3
wanted	523.3	523.8
to	523.8	523.9
be	523.9	524.0
this	524.0	524.0
phenomenal	524.0	524.8
kiss,	524.8	525.3
that	525.3	525.5
happened	525.5	525.8
at	525.8	525.9
this	525.9	526.0
phenomenal	526.0	526.5
moment	526.5	526.8
because	526.8	527.0
it's	527.0	528.1
you	528.1	528.5
just	528.5	533.7
had	533.7	533.8
to	533.8	533.9
be	533.9	534.0
in.	534.0	534.2
Now,	534.2	534.4
we've	534.4	535.1
reached	535.1	535.3
a	535.3	535.4
place	535.4	535.6
where	535.6	535.8
it's	535.8	535.9
just	535.9	536.1
got	536.1	536.3
to	536.3	536.3
be	536.3	536.4
one	536.4	536.7
of	536.7	536.7
those	536.7	536.8
things	536.8	536.9
where	536.9	537.2
I	537.2	537.3
just	537.3	537.5
like	537.5	537.7
you	537.7	538.1
sweep	538.1	538.9
everything	538.9	539.2
off	539.2	539.4
the	539.4	539.5
table	539.5	539.8
and	539.8	539.9
throw	539.9	540.4
you	540.4	540.5
down	540.5	540.7
on	540.7	540.9
it.	540.9	541.1
And	541.1	541.2
I'm	541.2	542.0
not	542.0	542.0
really	542.0	542.3
a	542.3	542.5
sweeping	542.5	543.7
sort	543.7	544.1
of	544.1	544.2
fella.	544.2	544.5
I	544.5	546.9
think	546.9	547.2
you	547.2	547.3
are	547.3	547.4
a	547.4	547.7
sweet	547.7	548.0
thing	548.0	548.1
sort	548.1	548.5
of	548.5	548.5
fella.	548.5	548.8
I	548.8	549.2
mean	549.2	549.4
you're	549.4	550.3
just	550.3	550.4
sweeper	550.4	550.9
trapped	550.9	551.5
inside	551.5	551.6
of	551.6	551.8
his	551.8	552.1
body.	552.1	552.5
Really	554.1	554.9
sure	554.9	555.9
but	555.9	556.1
you	556.1	556.2
should	556.2	556.4
just	556.4	556.5
do	556.5	556.8
it.	556.8	556.9
Just	556.9	557.2
sweep	557.2	557.6
and	557.6	557.7
throw	557.7	557.9
me.	557.9	558.0
now	562.3	562.7
now,	562.7	562.8
Do	569.6	569.9
you	569.9	570.0
know	570.0	570.1
what	570.1	570.2
this	570.2	570.3
is	570.3	570.4
just	570.4	570.6
really	570.6	570.7
expensive	570.7	571.3
and	571.3	573.8
this	573.8	574.4
was	574.4	574.6
a	574.6	574.7
gift.	574.7	574.8
Yeoman	580.7	584.4
actually,	584.4	584.6
Troyer	584.6	584.9
