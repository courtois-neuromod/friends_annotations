on	437.1	437.3
the	437.3	437.4
right	437.4	437.6
along	437.6	437.9
with	437.9	438.1
Gary	438.1	438.5
Wright	438.5	438.8
and	438.8	439.0
somebody	439.0	439.4
took	439.4	439.5
a	439.5	439.7
shot	439.7	439.7
at	439.7	440.2
me.	440.2	440.3
No,	445.5	446.0
a	446.0	446.1
car	446.1	446.4
backfire	446.4	447.1
but	447.1	447.6
I	447.6	449.8
thought	449.8	450.3
somebody	450.3	451.0
was	451.0	451.3
taking	451.3	451.7
a	451.7	451.8
shot	451.8	452.2
at	452.2	452.3
me	452.3	452.6
and	452.6	452.7
I	452.7	453.4
was	453.4	457.0
filled	457.0	457.5
with	457.5	457.7
this,	457.7	457.9
this	457.9	458.3
great	458.3	459.3
respect	459.3	460.4
for	460.4	460.6
life.	460.6	461.1
You	461.1	461.4
know,	461.4	461.5
I	461.5	461.7
want	461.7	462.2
to	462.2	462.2
experience	462.2	463.0
every	463.0	463.7
moment,	463.7	464.3
I	464.3	464.3
don't	464.3	464.5
seize	464.5	465.7
every	465.7	466.3
opportunity,	466.3	466.4
I	466.4	467.9
am	467.9	468.3
see	468.3	468.5
everything,	468.5	468.9
so	468.9	469.3
clearly	469.3	469.5
now.	469.5	470.7
well,	477.8	478.3
I	478.3	478.5
don't	478.5	478.9
know	478.9	479.1
how	479.1	479.3
this	479.3	479.4
fits	479.4	479.6
into	479.6	479.9
your	479.9	480.0
hole	480.0	480.3
seizing	480.3	481.0
saying	481.0	481.5
but	481.5	481.9
Emily	481.9	482.9
called	482.9	483.3
you	483.3	483.4
today	483.4	483.6
You	485.2	485.6
talked	485.6	485.8
to	485.8	485.9
her.	485.9	486.1
Now,	486.1	486.4
she	486.4	486.8
left	486.8	487.0
a	487.0	487.1
message.	487.1	487.5
Something	496.9	497.6
about	497.6	497.9
having	497.9	498.2
second	498.2	498.7
thoughts	498.7	498.8
about	498.8	499.1
the	499.1	499.4
wedding	499.4	499.9
and	499.9	500.0
did	500.0	500.2
you	500.2	500.3
guys	500.3	500.5
make	500.5	500.7
a	500.7	500.8
mistake	500.8	501.1
breaking	501.1	501.8
up	501.8	502.0
and	502.0	502.5
she	502.5	503.8
wants	503.8	504.0
you	504.0	504.0
to	504.0	504.0
call	504.0	504.3
her?	504.3	504.5
Wow.	506.3	506.7
Now,	507.7	508.2
that	508.2	508.4
was,	508.4	508.5
that	508.5	508.6
was	508.6	508.7
a	508.7	508.8
good	508.8	509.2
thing	509.2	509.3
that	509.3	509.6
I	509.6	509.8
told	509.8	510.0
you,	510.0	510.2
right?	510.2	510.4
Of	510.4	513.2
course.	513.2	513.7
Okay.	513.7	514.2
Thank	514.2	514.7
you.	514.7	514.9
Thank	514.9	515.1
you,	515.1	515.6
because	515.6	515.8
I'm	515.8	517.4
going	517.4	517.5
to	517.5	517.5
go.	517.5	517.6
You	517.6	519.8
know	519.8	519.9
what,	519.9	520.0
she	520.0	520.2
didn't	520.2	520.4
want	520.4	520.4
one	520.4	522.9
is,	522.9	523.1
I	523.1	523.5
was	523.5	523.8
right	523.8	524.1
your	524.1	524.8
decision,	524.8	525.3
okay,	525.3	526.6
I	526.6	527.6
was	527.6	527.9
right	527.9	528.2
your	528.2	529.5
decision.	529.5	530.7
I	532.5	532.8
guess,	532.8	533.2
I	533.2	533.4
guess	533.4	533.7
I	533.7	533.8
should	533.8	533.9
call	533.9	534.1
Emily.	534.1	534.7
That	542.5	543.0
woman	543.0	543.4
made	543.4	543.6
you	543.6	543.8
miserable.	543.8	544.3
Okay,	544.3	546.0
Ross.	546.0	546.3
I	546.3	546.6
mean	546.6	546.7
do	546.7	546.9
you	546.9	546.9
really	546.9	547.3
want	547.3	547.8
to	547.8	547.8
get	547.8	547.9
back	547.9	548.1
into	548.1	548.5
that?	548.5	548.7
Okay,	550.7	551.2
look	551.2	551.4
yesterday	551.4	552.1
I	552.1	553.0
would	553.0	553.2
have	553.2	553.2
even	553.2	553.5
considered	553.5	553.7
calling	553.7	554.5
her	554.5	554.7
back,	554.7	554.9
but	554.9	555.2
my	555.2	556.5
ex-wife	556.5	557.0
calls	557.0	557.5
on	557.5	557.6
the	557.6	557.8
same	557.8	558.4
day.	558.4	558.7
I	558.7	559.1
have	559.1	559.5
a	559.5	559.6
near-death	559.6	560.5
experience.	560.5	560.7
I	560.7	561.8
mean,	561.8	562.0
that	562.0	562.3
that's	562.3	562.5
gotta	562.5	562.9
mean	562.9	562.9
something.	562.9	563.5
Siri.	565.5	566.0
That	566.0	566.1
was	566.1	566.2
barely	566.2	566.7
an	566.7	566.9
experience.	566.9	567.9
You	569.1	569.4
weren't	569.4	569.8
there?	569.8	570.1
maybe	572.6	573.4
this	573.4	573.6
is	573.6	573.6
something	573.6	574.0
that	574.0	574.2
I	574.2	574.3
am	574.3	574.7
supposed	574.7	575.2
to	575.2	575.3
see	575.3	575.8
if	575.8	576.1
you	576.1	576.1
know,	576.1	576.5
Okay,	577.5	578.1
you	578.1	578.5
know	578.5	578.6
what?	578.6	578.9
Maybe	580.0	580.9
this	580.9	581.5
is	581.5	581.6
not	581.6	581.9
about	581.9	582.3
seizing	582.3	583.2
stuff.	583.2	583.7
Maybe	583.7	584.7
this	584.7	585.0
is	585.0	585.2
about	585.2	585.4
escaping	585.4	586.1
stuff	586.1	587.3
today.	587.3	589.5
I	589.5	590.2
mean	590.2	590.3
you	590.3	590.5
escaped.	590.5	591.1
Do	592.2	592.6
you	592.6	595.2
know?	595.2	595.4
And	595.4	595.8
maybe	595.8	595.9
this	595.9	596.8
is	596.8	597.0
a	597.0	597.2
chance	597.2	597.5
for	597.5	597.6
you	597.6	597.7
to	597.7	598.0
escape	598.0	598.2
getting	598.2	599.4
back	599.4	599.6
together	599.6	599.8
with	599.8	600.1
Emily.	600.1	600.5
That	602.1	602.5
does	602.5	602.9
make	602.9	603.1
sense	603.1	603.3
because	603.3	605.8
I	605.8	606.2
do	606.2	606.5
want	606.5	606.7
to	606.7	606.9
see	606.9	607.7
some	607.7	608.8
opportunity	608.8	609.6
but	609.6	609.9
I	609.9	610.0
I	610.0	610.1
really	610.1	610.4
don't	610.4	611.4
want	611.4	611.6
to	611.6	611.7
see	611.7	612.0
or	612.0	612.2
talk	612.2	612.3
to	612.3	612.6
her.	612.6	612.9
There	614.9	615.9
you	615.9	616.1
go,	616.1	616.3
baby.	616.3	618.5
Please	618.5	619.0
just	619.0	619.1
close	620.7	621.3
call	621.3	621.8
them.	621.8	622.2
Hey,	625.2	625.5
thanks	625.5	626.7
for	626.7	626.8
maybe	631.9	633.5
you	633.5	633.6
didn't	633.6	633.8
erase	633.8	634.1
it.	634.1	634.2
Hey,	643.2	643.5
what's	643.5	644.8
was	644.8	645.1
Monica	645.1	645.4

I	646.1	647.6
want	647.6	647.8
my	647.8	647.9
money	647.9	648.0
back	648.0	648.1
for	648.1	651.9
stamps,	651.9	652.6
right?	652.6	652.8
It	660.1	660.5
seems	660.5	660.9
to	660.9	661.5
have	661.5	661.8
been	661.8	661.9
shot	661.9	662.1
at	662.1	662.5
for	662.5	662.7
real.	662.7	663.0
Some	669.7	670.1
really	670.1	670.3
good	670.3	670.4
story.	670.4	670.9
if	678.2	678.8
I'm	678.8	679.0
sick	679.0	679.2
or	679.2	679.6
something,	679.6	680.2
or	680.2	682.2
after	682.2	690.7
you	690.7	690.7
were	690.7	690.8
shot	690.8	690.9
by	690.9	691.3
your	691.3	691.5
own	691.5	691.7
troops,	691.7	692.1
Jelly	693.9	694.4
would	694.4	694.6
be	694.6	694.7
if	694.7	695.1
you're	695.1	695.2
down	695.2	695.5
in	695.5	695.5
the	695.5	695.6
Foxhole	695.6	696.0
protecting	696.0	696.6
all	696.6	696.7
of	696.7	696.8
us.	696.8	697.1
Yes.	697.1	697.7
If	697.7	697.9
the	697.9	697.9
Foxhole	697.9	698.3
was	698.3	698.5
lined	698.5	698.8
with	698.8	698.9
sandwiches,	698.9	699.3
Yeah,	701.6	702.0
hero	702.0	702.4
sandwiches.	702.4	703.1
Are	706.4	706.7
you	706.7	706.9
on?	706.9	707.1
A	707.6	707.7
pacifist.	707.7	708.2
So	708.2	708.4
I'm	708.4	708.6
not	708.6	708.7
interested	708.7	709.0
in	709.0	709.2
war	709.2	709.5
in	709.5	709.9
any	709.9	710.0
way.	710.0	710.2
But	710.6	711.4
you	711.4	711.5
know	711.5	711.6
what?	711.6	711.8
When	711.8	712.2
the	712.2	712.3
revolution	712.3	712.8
comes,	712.8	713.0
I	713.0	713.1
will	713.1	713.3
have	713.3	713.5
to	713.5	713.6
destroy	713.6	713.9
you	713.9	714.0
all.	714.0	714.3
Not	715.5	715.8
usual.	715.8	716.2
