edit	508.7	508.9
my	508.9	509.1
new	509.1	509.3

Believe	509.6	511.0
that	511.0	511.2
I	511.2	512.0
haven't	512.0	512.3
spoken	512.3	512.7

him	512.7	512.9
in	512.9	513.0
10	513.0	514.0
years	514.0	514.2
and	514.2	514.8
he	514.8	514.9

me	515.5	515.6
for	515.6	515.9
a	515.9	516.2
favor.	516.2	516.3
yeah,	519.6	520.1
I've	520.1	520.2
always	520.2	520.4
hated	520.4	520.7
that	520.7	520.9
Howie	520.9	521.3
How	524.2	524.4
you	524.4	524.5
doing?	524.5	525.0
Refill.	529.3	531.4
Now,	533.7	534.1
this	534.1	534.2
is	534.2	534.4
last	534.4	534.8
minute,	534.8	534.9
so	534.9	535.3
I	535.3	535.3
want	535.3	535.6
to	535.6	535.7
apologize	535.7	535.9
for	535.9	536.5
the	536.5	536.6
mess.	536.6	537.1
Oh	541.9	542.3
my	542.3	542.6
God.	542.6	543.1
Shirt	543.1	544.4
and	544.4	544.5
look	544.5	544.6
this	544.6	544.7
way	544.7	545.0
when	545.0	545.2
I	545.2	545.2
lived	545.2	545.5
here.	545.5	545.6
There's	548.9	549.7
only	549.7	549.8
one	549.8	550.1
problem	550.1	550.3
though,	550.3	550.6
there's	550.6	550.9
only	550.9	551.0
room	551.0	551.2
for	551.2	551.3
one,	551.3	551.5
so	551.5	551.9
I	551.9	551.9
guess	551.9	552.2
one	552.2	552.5
of	552.5	552.6
you	552.6	552.7
will	552.7	552.8
have	552.8	552.9
to	552.9	553.0
stay	553.0	553.2
at	553.2	553.3
Joey's.	553.3	553.6
Well	553.6	555.4
since	555.4	555.7
the	555.7	556.0
fire	556.0	556.3
was	556.3	556.5
kind	556.5	556.8
of	556.8	557.0
my	557.0	557.1
fault,	557.1	557.2
I	557.2	557.5
guess	557.5	557.8
you	557.8	558.4
should	558.4	558.5
get	558.5	558.7
to	558.7	558.8
stay	558.8	559.1
here.	559.1	559.3
This	559.3	561.0
was	561.0	561.2
no	561.2	561.3
one's	561.3	561.6
fault	561.6	561.8
feeds.	561.8	562.5
Okay.	562.5	562.7
It	562.7	562.8
was	562.8	563.0
an	563.0	563.1
accident	563.1	563.5
when	563.5	563.8
though,	563.8	563.9
it	563.9	564.1
was	564.1	564.4
my	564.4	564.6
fault,	564.6	564.9
so	564.9	565.1
you	565.1	565.4
should	565.4	565.6
get	565.6	565.7
the	565.7	565.9
nice	565.9	566.1
room	566.1	566.5
rates.	566.5	569.7
You're	569.7	570.0

your	573.8	573.9
eggs	573.9	574.1
in	574.1	574.2
the	574.2	574.3
morning.	574.3	574.3
I	574.3	574.8
thought	574.8	575.1
I	575.1	575.3
would	575.3	575.4
bring	575.4	575.5
them	575.5	575.6
to	575.6	575.8
you	575.8	575.9

so	577.0	578.4
much	578.4	578.6
This	581.5	582.0
right	582.0	582.5
here	582.5	582.6
is	582.6	582.7
where	582.7	582.9
I	582.9	582.9
keep	582.9	583.1
the	583.1	583.3
pizza.	583.3	583.3
And	585.7	586.2
that's	586.2	586.7
where	586.7	586.8
the	586.8	586.9
