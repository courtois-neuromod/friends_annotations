but	288.2	288.6
I	288.6	288.7
got	288.7	288.9
you	288.9	289.0
believing	289.0	289.2
that	289.2	289.4
I	289.4	289.6
couldn't.	289.6	289.8

Yeah,	296.2	296.6
that	296.6	296.8
was	296.8	296.9
real.	296.9	297.2
I	302.0	302.3
know.	302.3	302.6
Put	302.6	303.3
so	303.3	303.5
what	303.5	303.7
are	303.7	303.8
you	303.8	303.8
going	303.8	303.9
to	303.9	304.0
tell	304.0	304.1
her?	304.1	304.2
Well,	304.9	305.4
I	305.4	306.4
told	306.4	306.5
him	306.5	306.7
I	306.7	306.8
would	306.8	306.9
think	306.9	306.9
about	306.9	307.2
it	307.2	307.4
but	307.4	307.9
I'm	307.9	308.1
going	308.1	308.1
to	308.1	308.3
tell	308.3	308.5
him.	308.5	308.6
No.	308.6	308.8
When	311.3	311.7
I	311.7	311.8
said,	311.8	311.9
I	311.9	311.9
do	311.9	312.1
not	312.1	312.3
know	312.3	312.4
anybody	312.4	312.8
right	312.8	313.0
now.	313.0	313.1
But	317.2	317.8
it's	317.8	318.0
so	318.0	318.2
strange.	318.2	318.9
I	318.9	319.2
mean	319.2	319.3
I'm	319.3	319.5
standing	319.5	320.4
there	320.4	320.4
with	320.4	320.7
this	320.7	320.9
charming.	320.9	322.2
Cute	322.2	322.8
guy	322.8	323.1
who's	323.1	323.6
asking	323.6	323.8
me	323.8	324.1
to	324.1	324.2
go	324.2	324.3
out	324.3	324.4
with	324.4	324.6
him	324.6	324.8
which	324.8	325.6
I'm	325.6	325.8
allowed	325.8	326.2
to	326.2	326.3
do	326.3	326.6
and	326.6	327.2
I	327.2	327.6
felt	327.6	328.1
guilty	328.1	328.4
you	328.4	329.6
know	329.6	329.7
I	329.7	329.7
got	329.7	329.8
to	329.8	329.9
be	329.9	330.0
cheating	330.0	330.3
on	330.3	330.4
Ross	330.4	330.9
or	330.9	331.0
something.	331.0	331.6
So	331.6	332.7
okay	332.7	333.6
maybe	333.6	333.7
that	333.7	334.8
means	334.8	334.9
that	334.9	335.4
you're	335.4	336.1
not	336.1	336.1
over	336.1	336.5
Ross	336.5	336.7
yet	336.7	337.2
and	337.2	337.8
you	337.8	338.0
have	338.0	338.2
issues	338.2	338.4
with	338.4	338.5
your	338.5	338.7
father.	338.7	339.0
How	343.2	343.5
many	343.5	343.8
issues	343.8	343.9
of	343.9	344.1
my	344.1	344.2
father	344.2	344.6
died.	344.6	345.5
So	345.5	345.7
it's	345.7	345.7
probably	345.7	345.9
just	345.9	346.1
the	346.1	346.3
Ross	346.3	346.6
thing	346.6	346.8
then.	346.8	347.0
I	349.1	349.4
hate	349.4	349.7
this	349.7	349.8
woman.	349.8	350.2
I	350.2	350.6
hate	350.6	350.9
her.	350.9	351.0
She	351.0	351.9
told	351.9	352.1
everyone	352.1	352.4
in	352.4	352.5
the	352.5	352.6
company	352.6	352.8
about	352.8	353.1
the	353.1	353.3
infomercial.	353.3	353.9
And	353.9	354.6
now	354.6	354.7
they	354.7	354.9
all	354.9	355.0
keep	355.0	355.3
asking	355.3	355.7
me	355.7	355.8
to	355.8	355.8
open	355.8	356.1
their	356.1	356.3
drinks.	356.3	356.7
Okay.	356.7	358.0
And	358.0	358.1
whenever	358.1	358.3
I	358.3	358.5
can't	358.5	358.8
do	358.8	359.0
it	359.0	359.2
there,	359.2	359.7
all	359.7	359.8
