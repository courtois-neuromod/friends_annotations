Joey,	1.2	2.6
Tribbiani	2.6	2.7
America.	2.7	3.7
I	12.2	13.1
just	13.1	13.3
spoke	13.3	13.5
to	13.5	13.6
your	13.6	13.7
dad	13.7	13.8
and	13.8	14.2
he	14.2	15.2
seems	15.2	15.5
to	15.5	15.6
think	15.6	15.6
we'll	15.6	15.9
be	15.9	16.0
able	16.0	16.1
to	16.1	16.1
find	16.1	16.3
a	16.3	16.4
new	16.4	16.6
place	16.6	16.9
for	16.9	17.0
the	17.0	17.2
wedding.	17.2	17.4
I'm	17.4	25.2
so	25.2	25.4
sad	25.4	26.0
about	26.0	26.1
who	26.1	26.4
I	31.2	34.4
said,	34.4	34.6
what?	34.6	34.8
Postpone	43.3	44.0
it	44.0	44.1
Emily.	44.1	46.4
Do	46.4	46.6
you	46.6	46.7
think	46.7	47.0
Monica	47.0	47.2
realizes	47.2	48.2
how	48.2	48.6
much	48.6	48.6
are	48.6	48.9
parents	48.9	49.4
spent	49.4	49.8
on	49.8	50.1
this	50.1	50.2
wedding?	50.2	50.5
Do	50.5	51.4
you	51.4	51.5
think	51.5	51.7
my	51.7	51.8
sister	51.8	52.0
is	52.0	52.2
teeny	52.2	52.8
tiny	52.8	53.4
little	53.4	53.6
brain	53.6	54.3
comprehend?	54.3	55.0
The	55.0	55.7
people	55.7	56.2
took	56.2	56.4
time	56.4	57.0
out	57.0	57.3
of	57.3	57.5
their	57.5	57.7
lives	57.7	58.1
to	58.1	58.2
fly,	58.2	58.5
thousands	58.5	59.3
of	59.3	59.4
miles	59.4	59.8
to	59.8	60.1
be	60.1	60.2
here.	60.2	60.8
Pictures	65.2	65.7
of	65.7	65.9
right.	65.9	66.2
We	80.8	81.1
have	81.1	81.3
no	81.3	81.5
choice	81.5	81.7
anyway.	81.7	83.2
So	83.2	84.1
what	84.1	93.6
are	93.6	93.7
you	93.7	93.8
saying?	93.8	94.1
It's	94.1	94.2
now	94.2	94.4
or	94.4	94.6
never.	94.6	94.6
Backwoods.	102.4	106.0
So	124.5	124.9
did	124.9	125.7
shopping	125.7	126.2
help?	126.2	126.3
You	126.3	126.5
feel	126.5	126.7
any	126.7	126.8
better	126.8	126.9
about	126.9	127.1
Ross	127.1	127.6
and	127.6	128.2
hat	128.2	128.4
and	128.4	128.5
does	128.5	128.6
not	128.6	128.8
have	128.8	129.0
enough	129.0	129.2
stores?	129.2	129.7
I	132.1	133.3
think	133.3	133.5
I	133.5	133.6
can	133.6	133.8
help	133.8	133.9
you	133.9	134.0
get	134.0	134.2
over	134.2	134.3
him.	134.3	134.6
You	134.6	135.1
can	135.1	135.5
I	135.5	136.5
just	136.5	136.5
need	136.5	136.8
you	136.8	136.9

photos	137.5	138.0
of	138.0	138.0
Ross	138.0	138.4
and	138.4	139.0
a	139.0	140.0
small	140.0	140.6
piece	140.6	140.8
of	140.8	140.9
chocolate	140.9	141.3
and	141.3	142.2
a	142.2	142.3
glass	142.3	142.7
of	142.7	142.9
tepid	142.9	143.5
water.	143.5	143.7
Is	143.7	144.8
this	144.8	145.0
one	145.0	145.2
of	145.2	145.3
those	145.3	145.4
things	145.4	145.7
where	145.7	146.0
you	146.0	146.1
prove?	146.1	146.4
I'm	146.4	146.5
just	146.5	146.7
having	146.7	146.9
a	146.9	146.9
bad	146.9	147.0
with	147.0	147.5
some	147.5	147.6
graveyard	147.6	148.0
dirt	148.0	148.4
and	148.4	148.7
hang	148.7	149.0
it	149.0	149.1
from	149.1	149.2
the	149.2	149.3
north-facing	149.3	149.7
tree.	149.7	150.3
Only,	150.3	151.4
if	151.4	151.6
you	151.6	151.7
have	151.7	152.0
the	152.0	152.1
hiccups	152.1	152.3
to	152.3	152.7
The	155.6	156.3
pictures	156.3	156.6
are	156.6	156.7
for	156.7	156.8
you	156.8	156.9
in	156.9	157.0
the	157.0	157.1
shop	157.1	157.3
in	157.3	157.5
the	157.5	157.6
waters	157.6	157.9
for	157.9	158.0
me.	158.0	158.2
I	158.2	158.2
just	158.2	158.3
don't	158.3	158.6
feel	158.6	158.7
like	158.7	158.8
getting	158.8	158.9
up.	158.9	159.1
I	162.1	162.3
show	162.3	162.5
you	162.5	162.7
a	162.7	162.7
picture	162.7	163.1
of	163.1	163.3
Ross	163.3	163.6
okay	163.6	164.2
and	164.2	164.8
you're	164.8	165.2
going	165.2	165.2
to	165.2	165.5
remember	165.5	165.8
all	165.8	166.2
the	166.2	166.4
bad	166.4	166.4
things	166.4	166.8
about	166.8	167.0
him.	167.0	167.4
Alright.	167.4	167.8
Really	167.8	168.2
focus	168.2	169.0
on	169.0	169.1
his	169.1	169.3
flaws	169.3	169.8
can	169.8	170.1
do	170.1	170.2
that.	170.2	170.5
Certainly	170.5	171.0
did	171.0	171.2
that	171.2	171.3
while	171.3	171.5
we	171.5	171.6
were	171.6	171.7
going	171.7	171.8
out	171.8	172.1
before	172.1	175.1
we	175.1	175.2
get	175.2	175.3
started	175.3	175.4
I	175.4	175.9
just	175.9	176.1
want	176.1	176.2
to	176.2	176.3
say	176.3	176.5
for	176.5	176.6
the	176.6	176.7
record	176.7	176.8
that	176.8	177.3
I	177.3	177.6
love	177.6	178.0
Ross,	178.0	178.3
I	178.3	178.4
think	178.4	178.4
he's	178.4	178.7
such	178.7	179.0
a	179.0	179.0
great	179.0	179.1
guy.	179.1	179.3
Okay.	183.6	185.2
Now	185.2	185.9
And	188.0	188.4
imagine	188.4	188.8
that	188.8	188.9
you're	188.9	189.0
with	189.0	189.3
Ross	189.3	189.6
and	189.6	191.1
imagine	191.1	191.6
that	191.6	192.0
you're	192.0	192.1
kissing	192.1	192.4
him	192.4	192.7
and	192.7	193.8
you're	193.8	193.9
you're	193.9	194.1
running	194.1	194.4
your	194.4	194.5
hands	194.5	194.9
all	194.9	195.2
over	195.2	195.3
his	195.3	195.6
body	195.6	195.7
and	195.7	197.0
then	197.0	197.2
you	197.2	197.3
run	197.3	197.4
your	197.4	197.6
hands	197.6	197.9
through	197.9	198.1
his	198.1	198.2
hair,	198.2	198.3
some	198.3	201.3
kind	201.3	201.3
of	201.3	201.6
blank.	201.6	202.1
Never	207.7	210.4
bothered	210.4	210.9
me	210.9	210.9
that	210.9	211.0
much	211.0	211.5
and	211.5	212.0
you	212.0	212.1
know	212.1	212.2
it	212.2	212.3
was	212.3	212.4
it	212.4	212.5
was	212.5	212.7
always	212.7	212.8
more	212.8	213.0
than	213.0	213.3
it	213.3	213.8
was	213.8	214.0
harder	214.0	218.0
than	218.0	218.1
I	218.1	218.2
thought.	218.2	220.0
Streisand	220.0	220.7
version	220.7	221.3
therapy.	221.3	222.0
Okay.	222.0	222.4
Hey,	233.3	234.2
how	234.2	234.4

you	234.5	234.5
feel	234.5	234.8
now?	234.8	234.8
Like	234.8	236.7
you	236.7	237.1
laugh.	237.1	237.6
Wow,	251.5	252.6
this	252.6	252.8
is	252.8	252.9
just	252.9	253.2
as	253.2	253.3
boring	253.3	253.6
in	253.6	253.8
England.	253.8	254.2
Hey.	261.5	261.9
Sorry.	268.0	271.0
You	271.0	271.2

I'm	271.4	271.6
sorry.	271.6	271.9
I	271.9	272.2
really	272.2	272.4
shouldn't.	272.4	273.0
Have	273.0	273.0
said	273.0	273.1
that	273.1	273.4
you	273.4	273.6
are	273.6	273.7
embarrassing	273.7	274.2
me.	274.2	274.3
I	274.3	274.5
mean	274.5	274.7
I	274.7	274.8
really	274.8	274.8
wasn't	274.8	275.3
cool	275.3	275.7
and	275.7	276.2
it	276.2	276.4
makes	276.4	276.7
you	276.7	276.7
feel	276.7	276.8
any	276.8	277.0
better.	277.0	277.2
I've	277.2	278.3
had	278.3	278.4
a	278.4	278.4
really	278.4	278.7
lousy	278.7	279.2
day.	279.2	279.6
Me	281.3	281.8
too.	281.8	282.0
Yeah,	283.0	283.4
no.	283.4	284.1
I	284.1	286.6
had	286.6	286.8
the	286.8	286.9
best	286.9	287.0
day	287.0	287.2
ever.	287.2	287.5
To	289.3	289.7
check	289.7	290.0
this	290.0	290.3
out.	290.3	290.4
I	290.4	292.4
never	292.4	292.7
know	292.7	292.8
fast	292.8	293.1
forward	293.1	293.4
past	293.4	293.7
the	293.7	293.8
part	293.8	294.0
with	294.0	294.1
you	294.1	294.2
because	294.2	294.6
it	294.6	294.7
is	294.7	294.8
boring.	294.8	295.0
Okay,	301.4	301.8
so	301.8	301.9
say	301.9	302.1
hi	302.1	302.2
to	302.2	302.3
my	302.3	302.4
friend	302.4	302.7
and	302.7	302.7
tell	302.7	302.9
me	302.9	302.9
you	302.9	303.0
like	303.0	303.2
my	303.2	303.3
hat.	303.3	303.4
He	313.6	314.0
says	314.0	314.3
he	314.3	314.4
don't	314.4	314.5
really	314.5	314.7
like	314.7	314.9
his	314.9	315.2
hat,	315.2	315.3
but	315.3	315.7
I	315.7	316.0
think	316.0	316.3
it's	316.3	316.4
kind	316.4	316.6
of	316.6	316.6
fashion.	316.6	317.0
So	319.6	320.0
I	320.0	320.1
hear	320.1	320.3
you're	320.3	320.4
single	320.4	320.7
now.	320.7	320.8
Yeah,	322.5	322.9
I	322.9	323.0
did	323.0	323.9
not	323.9	323.9
have	323.9	324.2
that	324.2	324.3
much	324.3	324.7
favor.	324.7	335.8
I	335.8	337.0
understand	337.0	337.5
you	337.5	337.6
had	337.6	337.8
a	337.8	337.9
little	337.9	337.9
talk	337.9	338.3
with	338.3	338.6
Emily.	338.6	339.1
Yes,	339.1	340.4
I	340.4	340.5
did.	340.5	341.0
And	341.0	342.2
you	342.2	342.6
are	342.6	342.9
welcome.	342.9	343.1
Ramon.	345.5	346.5
And	348.3	348.7
was	348.7	348.8
it	348.8	348.9
your	348.9	349.2
idea	349.2	349.3
to	349.3	349.6
postpone	349.6	350.0
the	350.0	350.3
wedding?	350.3	350.4
I	352.8	353.3
want	353.3	354.5
to	354.5	354.6
go	354.6	354.6
to	354.6	354.7
the	354.7	354.8
bathroom.	354.8	355.1
Since	358.3	359.6
you're	359.6	359.7
the	359.7	359.9
Fix-It	359.9	360.5
lady,	360.5	361.0
here's	361.0	361.6
a	361.6	361.7
pickle.	361.7	362.1
What	362.1	363.2
do	363.2	363.3
you	363.3	363.4
do?	363.4	363.6
When	363.6	363.8
the	363.8	363.9
brine	363.9	364.4
says	364.4	364.8
she	364.8	365.0
doesn't	365.0	365.2
want	365.2	365.3
to	365.3	365.4
have	365.4	365.5
the	365.5	365.7
wedding	365.7	365.9
at	365.9	366.7
all?	366.7	367.1
She	367.1	368.1
said	368.1	368.5
that,	368.5	368.5
I	368.5	370.6
don't	370.6	370.8
know.	370.8	370.9
I	370.9	371.3
told	371.3	371.5
her	371.5	371.6
it	371.6	371.7
was	371.7	371.8
stupid	371.8	372.2
to	372.2	372.3
put	372.3	372.4
off	372.4	372.5
the	372.5	372.6
wedding	372.6	372.7
just	372.7	373.2
because	373.2	373.3
the	373.3	373.7
hall	373.7	374.0
was	374.0	374.3
gone	374.3	374.8
and	374.8	374.9
she	374.9	375.1
like	375.1	375.3
flipped	375.3	375.6
out	375.6	376.1
Oh	377.2	377.5
my	377.5	377.7
God,	377.7	378.2
you're	378.2	379.2
even	379.2	379.5
dumber	379.5	379.6
than	379.6	379.9
I	379.9	380.1
am?	380.1	380.4
How	383.9	384.8
long	384.8	384.9
have	384.9	385.0
you	385.0	385.1
been	385.1	385.1
planning	385.1	385.4
this	385.4	385.5
wedding?	385.5	385.7
I	387.1	387.5
don't	387.5	387.7
know	387.7	387.8
what	387.8	387.9
month.	387.9	388.3
Emily	388.3	389.0
has	389.0	389.1
probably	389.1	389.5
been	389.5	389.7
planning	389.7	390.2
it	390.2	390.2
since	390.2	390.3
she	390.3	390.6
was	390.6	390.7
5	390.7	391.3
ever	391.3	392.4
since	392.4	392.6
the	392.6	392.7
first	392.7	392.7
time	392.7	393.0
she	393.0	393.2
took	393.2	393.3
a	393.3	393.4
pillowcase	393.4	393.8
and	393.8	394.1
hung	394.1	394.2
it	394.2	394.3
off	394.3	394.4
the	394.4	394.6
back	394.6	394.7
of	394.7	394.8
her	394.8	395.0
head.	395.0	395.2
That's	397.2	397.7
what	397.7	397.9
we	397.9	398.0
did.	398.0	398.4
We	398.4	399.9
dreamed	399.9	400.4
about	400.4	400.5
the	400.5	400.8
perfect	400.8	401.3
wedding.	401.3	401.6
The	402.9	403.3
perfect	403.3	403.9
place.	403.9	404.2
What's	405.9	406.3
the	406.3	406.4
perfect	406.4	406.7
for	406.7	407.0
tiered	407.0	407.3
wedding	407.3	407.5
cake?	407.5	408.0
Beautiful	410.2	410.9
people	410.9	411.3
on	411.3	411.4
top.	411.4	411.6
But	421.1	421.5
the	421.5	421.6
most	421.6	422.0
important	422.0	422.8
part	422.8	423.2
is	423.2	424.5
that	424.5	424.6
we	424.6	424.8
had	424.8	425.0
the	425.0	425.1
perfect	425.1	425.6
guy	425.6	426.0
who	426.0	427.3
understood	427.3	427.7
just	427.7	428.0
how	428.0	428.2
important	428.2	428.3
all	428.3	428.9
that	428.9	429.1
other	429.1	429.3
stuff	429.3	429.4
was.	429.4	429.8
I	432.9	433.2
had	433.2	433.3
no	433.3	433.5
idea.	433.5	433.6
And	435.9	436.3
that,	436.3	436.4
that	436.4	436.6
pillowcase	436.6	437.2
thing	437.2	437.8
I	437.8	437.9
thought	437.9	438.1
you	438.1	438.2
guys	438.2	438.4
were	438.4	438.6
just	438.6	438.6
doing	438.6	439.1
The	439.1	439.1
Flying	439.1	439.5
Nun.	439.5	439.9
Sometimes	442.3	443.1
we	443.1	443.2
worked.	443.2	443.7
Come	446.4	446.7
on.	446.7	447.0
Going	448.2	448.6
to	448.6	448.6
help	448.6	448.8
me	448.8	448.9

out	449.1	449.2
what	449.2	449.3
to	449.3	449.5
do.	449.5	449.7
I	460.1	460.4
hope	460.4	460.7
Ross	460.7	460.9
didn't	460.9	461.2
think	461.2	461.4
we	461.4	461.5
just	461.5	461.5
went	461.5	461.8
in	461.8	461.9
there	461.9	462.1
because	462.1	462.3
we	462.3	462.4
were	462.4	462.5
uncomfortable	462.5	462.8
being	462.8	463.1
out	463.1	463.3
here.	463.3	463.4
I	471.0	471.3
hope	471.3	471.7
you	471.7	471.8
did.	471.8	472.3
Raw	479.0	481.1

Hello,	494.4	494.9

just	499.6	499.9
saw	499.9	500.1
someone	500.1	500.4

just	501.1	501.2
