more,	230.2	230.4
like,	230.4	230.5
a	230.5	230.6
movie	230.6	230.8
than	230.8	231.1
a	231.1	231.1
play.	231.1	231.4
Let	231.4	233.5
me	233.5	233.6
ask	233.6	233.7

you're	241.5	241.6
fine.	241.6	241.9
But	241.9	242.8
the	242.8	243.0
rule	243.0	243.3
is	243.3	243.4
when	243.4	244.1
two	244.1	244.4
actors	244.4	244.8
are	244.8	245.0

the	247.4	247.6
sexual	247.6	248.5
tension	248.5	248.7
between	248.7	249.0
them	249.0	249.4
is	249.4	249.6
Don,	249.6	249.9
okay?	249.9	250.8
On	250.8	252.3
stage,	252.3	252.9

got	253.6	253.7
nothing	253.7	254.0
to	254.0	254.0
worry	254.0	254.1
about	254.1	254.4
it,	254.4	255.1
that's	255.1	256.2
when	256.2	256.6
you're	256.6	256.7
in	256.7	256.8
trouble.	256.8	256.9
Really	259.0	259.6
look.	259.6	259.9
