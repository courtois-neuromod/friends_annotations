get	519.7	520.0
back	520.0	520.2
together	520.2	520.4
with	520.4	520.7
her.	520.7	520.9
I	520.9	521.0

I	521.1	521.4
know	521.4	521.7
that,	521.7	521.8
you	521.8	522.1

even	522.4	522.8
Ross	522.8	523.3
knows	523.3	523.9
that,	523.9	524.1
but	524.1	525.1

still	525.3	525.4
doesn't	525.4	525.6
give	525.6	525.7
us	525.7	525.9
the	525.9	525.9
right	525.9	526.0

message.	526.6	526.8
I	526.8	528.6

sister.	528.8	529.0
Okay,	529.0	529.5
I'm	529.5	530.3
not	530.3	530.4
the	530.4	530.6

I	530.7	530.8
don't	530.8	530.9
want	530.9	530.9

see	531.1	531.2
him	531.2	531.3
to	531.3	531.5
hurt.	531.5	532.0
Someone	532.0	532.6
doesn't	532.6	532.9
give	532.9	533.1
me	533.1	533.3
the	533.3	533.3
right	533.3	533.4

Help	534.2	536.9
him.	536.9	537.2
I	537.2	539.1
don't	539.1	539.3
think	539.3	539.4
he's	539.4	539.7
the	539.7	539.8
one	539.8	540.0
who	540.0	540.1
needs	540.1	540.2
help.	540.2	540.4
Obviously	543.2	544.6
unstable	544.6	545.0
about	545.0	546.3
running	546.3	546.6
out	546.6	546.7
on	546.7	546.8

wedding	547.0	547.5
day.	547.5	547.6
Okay	552.4	552.8
fine.	552.8	553.2
But	553.2	553.4
let	553.4	553.5
me	553.5	553.6
look	553.6	553.7
at	553.7	553.8
the	553.8	553.9
position.	553.9	554.0
She's	554.0	554.5
putting	554.5	554.8
him	554.8	555.0
in.	555.0	555.3
I	556.6	556.6
was	556.6	557.1
going	557.1	557.3
to	557.3	557.3
do	557.3	557.4
like	557.4	557.7
going	557.7	558.4

wedding	559.5	559.7
day	559.7	559.9
and	559.9	560.1
break	560.1	560.3
up	560.3	560.5
the	560.5	560.6
marriage.	560.6	560.8
Okay,	567.3	567.7
fine,	567.7	568.1
but	568.1	568.8
that's	568.8	568.9
no	568.9	569.4
different.	569.4	570.2
Although	571.8	572.2
it	572.2	572.3
did	572.3	572.4
involve	572.4	572.6
a	572.6	572.8
lot	572.8	572.9
of	572.9	573.0
the	573.0	573.1
same	573.1	573.1
people.	573.1	573.4
Obviously	575.4	576.5
someone	576.5	576.7
Twisted	576.7	577.2
jokes.	577.2	577.7
Just	577.7	577.8

crazy.	579.4	579.8
I'm	579.8	580.0
sorry,	580.0	580.2
but	580.2	580.4
she	580.4	580.5
sounded	580.5	580.7
genuinely	580.7	581.5
upset.	581.5	581.7
I	581.7	582.1
mean	582.1	582.2
margarita.	589.4	591.8
But	602.9	603.3

don't	609.5	609.6
get	609.6	609.7
your	609.7	609.9
head	609.9	610.1
blown	610.1	610.2

Okay,	610.5	616.6

he	616.7	616.8
comes.	616.8	617.2
What	618.6	619.0

he	619.1	619.2
doing?	619.2	619.5
What	619.5	620.0
the	620.0	620.1
hell	620.1	620.4
is	620.4	620.6

It's	642.6	643.2
okay.	643.2	643.5
