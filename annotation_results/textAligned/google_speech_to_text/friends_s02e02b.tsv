us	508.4	508.5
should	508.5	508.7
hang	508.7	508.9
out	508.9	509.0
for	509.0	509.2
a	509.2	509.3
bit.	509.3	509.3
I	509.3	510.2
mean,	510.2	510.3
you	510.3	510.4
know,	510.4	510.5
we've	510.5	510.6
never	510.6	510.8
really	510.8	511.0
talked.	511.0	511.7
I	512.9	513.2
guess	513.2	513.5
you'd	513.5	513.6
know	513.6	513.7
that	513.7	513.9
being	513.9	514.2
one	514.2	514.3
of	514.3	514.4
the	514.4	514.5
two	514.5	514.6
of	514.6	514.7
us.	514.7	514.9
I	518.5	518.9
probably	518.9	519.2
shouldn't	519.2	519.5
even	519.5	519.6
tell	519.6	520.4
you	520.4	520.5
this	520.5	520.7
but	520.7	521.0
I'm	521.0	521.2
pretty	521.2	522.4
much	522.4	522.6
totally	522.6	523.9
intimidated	523.9	524.2
by	524.2	524.8
you.	524.8	525.0
Oh	529.0	529.2

you	534.1	534.2
to	534.2	534.3
like	534.3	534.6
me.	534.6	534.7
And	534.7	535.0
I	535.0	535.2
know	535.2	535.7
it's	535.7	536.7
probably	536.7	536.9
me	536.9	537.2
just	537.2	537.2
being	537.2	537.5
totally	537.5	538.0
paranoid,	538.0	538.0
but	538.0	538.6
I	538.6	538.8
kind	538.8	539.8
of	539.8	539.9
got	539.9	539.9
the	539.9	540.2
feeling	540.2	540.2
that	540.2	540.6
maybe	540.6	541.5
you	541.5	541.9
don't.	541.9	542.7
Well.	549.6	550.3
You're	552.1	552.6
not	552.6	552.9
totally	552.9	553.2
paranoid.	553.2	553.9
Okay.	559.6	560.3

was	570.6	570.8
really	570.8	571.0
hard	571.0	571.2
for	571.2	571.5
me.	571.5	571.5
For	574.6	575.1
many	575.1	575.3
reasons	575.3	575.5
of	575.5	576.5
which	576.5	576.6
I'm	576.6	576.8
