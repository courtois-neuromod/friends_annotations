in	417.3	417.4
the	417.4	417.5
script	417.5	417.6
was	417.6	418.1
if	418.1	418.9
we	418.9	419.1
don't	419.1	419.2
get	419.2	419.3
this	419.3	419.5
woman	419.5	419.7
to	419.7	419.8
a	419.8	419.9
hospital,	419.9	420.6
she's	420.6	421.0
going	421.0	421.1

Okay,	426.8	430.4

read	437.7	437.9
this.	437.9	438.0
Never	440.7	441.1
really	441.1	441.3
thought	441.3	441.4
about	441.4	441.6
the	441.6	441.8
writer's,	441.8	442.2
the	442.2	442.5
