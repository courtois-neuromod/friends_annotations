the	341.4	341.4
truth.	341.4	341.5
Me,	341.5	342.0
I	342.0	345.7
thought	345.7	345.9
of	345.9	346.1
the	346.1	346.2
joke,	346.2	346.4
2	346.4	346.6
months	346.6	346.8
ago	346.8	347.0
at	347.0	347.7
lunch	347.7	347.9
with	347.9	348.1
Steve,	348.1	348.6
do	348.6	351.7
you	351.7	351.8
want	351.8	352.0
me	352.0	352.0
to	352.0	352.1
pick	352.1	352.2
you	352.2	352.4
up?	352.4	352.5
I	354.3	355.1
would	355.1	355.4
never	355.4	355.6
snap	355.6	356.2
at	356.2	356.4
you	356.4	356.6
like	356.6	356.7
that.	356.7	357.0
Continue.	365.9	366.6
Okay.	366.6	367.0
So	367.0	367.6
Steve	367.6	367.9
said	367.9	368.2
he	368.2	368.3
had	368.3	368.4
to	368.4	368.4
go	368.4	368.5
to	368.5	368.6
the	368.6	368.7
doctor	368.7	369.2
and	369.2	369.3
Steve.	369.3	369.8
Doctor's	369.8	370.3
name	370.3	370.4
is	370.4	370.6
dr.	370.6	370.7
Monty	370.7	371.4
so	371.4	372.4
I	372.4	372.5
said	372.5	372.9
Doctor	372.9	373.5
monkey	373.5	373.7
and	373.7	374.7
that	374.7	375.0
is	375.0	375.2
how	375.2	375.4
the	375.4	375.5
whole	375.5	375.8
doctor	375.8	376.2
monkey	376.2	376.3
thing	376.3	376.8
came	376.8	377.0
up.	377.0	377.1
Are	381.5	381.9

feeling	382.2	383.0
okay	383.0	384.2
I'm	384.2	385.3

I'm	390.4	390.7

Arm	397.0	397.7
doctor,	397.7	398.2

I'm	401.8	402.1
not	402.1	402.3
arguing	402.3	402.5
with	402.5	402.9
that.	402.9	403.0
I	403.0	405.0
made	405.0	406.1
my	406.1	406.2
decision.	406.2	406.4
The	412.1	412.4
joke	412.4	412.7
is	412.7	412.8
not	412.8	412.9
funny	412.9	413.1
and	413.1	413.8
it's	413.8	414.0
offensive	414.0	414.3
to	414.3	414.5
women	414.5	414.6
and	414.6	415.8
doctors	415.8	416.2
and	416.2	416.6
monkeys.	416.6	417.2
Arguing	419.4	420.2
over	420.2	420.3
who	420.3	420.5
gets	420.5	420.7
credit	420.7	421.0
for	421.0	421.3
who	421.3	422.4
gets	422.4	422.5
blamed	422.5	423.2
for	423.2	423.8
inflicting,	423.8	424.2
a	424.2	424.3
terrible	424.3	424.9
joke,	424.9	425.1
upon	425.1	425.4
the	425.4	425.6
world.	425.6	426.0
That	426.0	426.7
Let	426.7	427.0
It	427.0	427.2
Go	427.2	427.3
the	427.3	428.2
joke.	428.2	428.7
JoJo	435.6	436.4
is	436.4	436.6
not.	436.6	436.7
Are	453.5	454.2
there	454.2	454.4
you	454.4	454.6
are.	454.6	454.7
Why	457.6	460.1
don't	460.1	460.3
you	460.3	460.4
tell	460.4	460.6
them	460.6	460.8
what	460.8	461.1
you're	461.1	461.5
telling	461.5	461.8
me	461.8	461.8
earlier	461.8	461.9
about	461.9	462.3
me?	462.3	462.6
Not	462.6	463.0
being	463.0	463.1
high	463.1	463.5
maintenance.	463.5	463.7
Monica	466.9	468.0
is	468.0	468.3
a	468.3	468.4
self-sufficient	468.4	469.5
together,	469.5	470.0
lady.	470.0	470.4
Being	473.0	473.5
with	473.5	473.7
her	473.7	473.9
has	473.9	474.0
been	474.0	474.2
like,	474.2	474.4
being	474.4	474.7
on	474.7	474.8
a	474.8	474.9
vacation.	474.9	475.2
and	478.4	478.8
what	478.8	479.0
may	479.0	479.1
be	479.1	479.2
perceived	479.2	479.7
as	479.7	480.7
high-maintenance	480.7	481.1
is	481.1	481.9
merely	481.9	482.2
a	482.2	482.4
attention	482.4	483.0
to	483.0	483.4
detail	483.4	484.0
and	484.0	484.7
Generosity	486.4	487.4
of	487.4	487.8
spirit.	487.8	488.1
Wow.	491.0	491.6
You	491.6	492.2
know	492.2	492.3
what?	492.3	492.6
That	492.6	492.8
is	492.8	492.9
the	492.9	493.0
best	493.0	493.5
fake	493.5	493.9
speech?	493.9	494.4
I	494.4	494.5
think	494.5	494.8
I've	494.8	494.9
ever	494.9	495.0
heard	495.0	495.3
really	495.3	495.9
never	495.9	496.6
better	496.6	497.0
came	497.0	499.8
up	499.8	499.9
with	499.9	500.0
that	500.0	500.1
himself.	500.1	500.2
I'm	503.2	503.4
out	503.4	503.6
of	503.6	503.6
work.	503.6	503.7
Should	503.7	504.0
I	504.0	504.1
just	504.1	504.3
say	504.3	504.4
the	504.4	504.5
whole	504.5	504.6
thing	504.6	504.7
again?	504.7	505.0
Does	512.1	512.6
middle	512.6	512.9
high	512.9	513.0
maintenance?	513.0	513.3
My	516.0	516.2
list.	516.2	516.6
But	518.9	519.6
you	519.6	519.7
do	519.7	519.8
not,	519.8	519.9
you're	519.9	520.8
not	520.8	520.8
easy	520.8	521.2
going,	521.2	521.6
but	521.6	522.2
you're,	522.2	522.4
you're	522.4	522.5
passionate	522.5	523.2
and	523.2	523.8
that's	523.8	524.0
good	524.0	524.2
and	524.2	525.3
when	525.3	525.4
you	525.4	525.5
get	525.5	525.7
upset	525.7	525.9
about	525.9	526.3
the	526.3	526.6
little	526.6	526.9
things,	526.9	527.0
I	527.0	527.5
think	527.5	527.6
that	527.6	527.8
I'm	527.8	528.1
pretty	528.1	528.4
good	528.4	528.5

you	529.6	529.8
feel	529.8	530.1
better	530.1	530.3
about	530.3	530.6
that,	530.6	530.8
and	530.8	531.4
that's	531.4	531.5
good	531.5	531.8
too,	531.8	532.1
so	532.1	532.7
they	532.7	532.9
can	532.9	533.1
say	533.1	533.3
to	533.3	533.5
your	533.5	533.6
high	533.6	533.8
maintenance.	533.8	534.1
But	534.1	534.5
it's	534.5	534.6
okay	534.6	535.1
because	535.1	535.4
I	535.4	535.8

it	549.7	549.8
to	549.8	549.8
say	549.8	550.0
that.	550.0	550.1
It's	560.2	560.7
okay	560.7	561.0
that	561.0	561.2
you	561.2	561.2
don't	561.2	561.3
want	561.3	561.5
to	561.5	561.6
be	561.6	561.6
your	561.6	561.8
