I	528.6	528.6
just	528.6	528.9
I	528.9	529.6
just	529.6	529.6
thought	529.6	529.8
it	529.8	530.0
would	530.0	530.1
be	530.1	530.1
a	530.1	530.3
very	530.3	530.4
good	530.4	530.6
idea	530.6	530.8
to	530.8	531.0
talk	531.0	531.3
about	531.3	531.5
this	531.5	531.7

know.	533.0	533.1
I	534.7	535.9
really	535.9	536.2
don't	536.2	536.4
think	536.4	536.4
it's	536.4	536.6
a	536.6	536.7
very	536.7	536.9
good	536.9	536.9
idea	536.9	537.1
if	537.1	537.4
you	537.4	537.5
be	537.5	537.6
Why	539.0	539.4
not?	539.4	539.7
Because	539.7	541.5
you'd	541.5	541.6
be	541.6	541.7
giving	541.7	541.9
up	541.9	542.1
a	542.1	542.2
baby.	542.2	542.6
And	542.6	543.5
I	543.5	543.7
I	543.7	543.8
really	543.8	544.3
don't,	544.3	544.6
I	544.6	545.4
don't	545.4	545.5
know	545.5	545.7
if	545.7	545.8
there's	545.8	546.0
anything	546.0	546.2
that	546.2	546.3
I	546.3	546.5
could	546.5	546.6
say,	546.6	546.9
they	546.9	547.1
could	547.1	547.2
make	547.2	547.4
you	547.4	547.5
understand	547.5	548.2
the	548.2	548.3
pain	548.3	548.7
of	548.7	548.9
giving	548.9	548.9
up	548.9	549.2
a	549.2	549.3
baby.	549.3	549.7
So,	551.3	551.7
Oh	555.6	555.9
no,	555.9	556.3
no,	556.3	556.3
no.	556.3	556.4
I	556.4	557.0
understand	557.0	557.5
the	557.5	557.6
pain	557.6	557.8
don't	557.8	558.1
don't	558.1	558.3
hurt	558.3	558.5
the	558.5	558.6
puppy.	558.6	558.9
No,	558.9	561.0

but	565.6	565.8
for	565.8	566.2
only	566.2	566.3
three	566.3	566.5
days.	566.5	566.6
you	570.8	571.2
know,	571.2	571.2
I	571.2	571.4
realized	571.4	572.1
that	572.1	572.1
I	572.1	572.2
don't	572.2	572.3
have	572.3	572.4
any	572.4	572.7
right	572.7	572.9
to	572.9	573.1
start	573.1	573.4
getting	573.4	573.6
all	573.6	574.0
parity	574.0	574.8
on	574.8	574.9
you	574.9	575.0
and	575.0	575.1
everything	575.1	575.4
now,	575.4	575.6
but	575.6	575.9
Baby,	582.0	582.5
would	582.5	582.7
you	582.7	582.7
please	582.7	582.9
look	582.9	583.0
at	583.0	583.2
me	583.2	583.3
and	583.3	583.4
not	583.4	583.5
the	583.5	583.6
puppy.	583.6	583.9
It's	583.9	584.1
great	584.1	584.5
for	584.5	584.6
the	584.6	584.8
time.	584.8	585.0
Okay.	585.0	586.0
I	586.0	587.0
mean,	587.0	587.1
I	587.1	587.2
know	587.2	587.4
what	587.4	587.4
I'm	587.4	587.6
talking	587.6	587.8
about.	587.8	588.1
I	589.6	589.9
gave	589.9	590.2
up	590.2	590.3
two	590.3	590.6
babies	590.6	591.0
and	591.0	592.2
I	592.2	592.7
only	592.7	593.0
wish	593.0	593.1
that	593.1	593.2
I	593.2	593.4
had	593.4	593.6
someone	593.6	593.9
there	593.9	594.0
had	594.0	594.4
given	594.4	594.6
up	594.6	594.8
babies,	594.8	595.1
that	595.1	595.2
could	595.2	595.4
have	595.4	595.5
told	595.5	595.8
me	595.8	595.9
how	595.9	597.3
terrible	597.3	597.7
it	597.7	597.8
is	597.8	597.9
to	597.9	598.0
give	598.0	598.2
up	598.2	598.4
babies.	598.4	598.9
I	601.7	601.9
really	601.9	602.2
shouldn't	602.2	602.4
have	602.4	602.5
given	602.5	602.6
you	602.6	602.8
the	602.8	602.9
puppy	602.9	603.2
first.	603.2	603.7
That's	606.9	607.3
okay.	607.3	608.3
We're	608.3	608.4
listening.	608.4	608.8
I	608.8	610.3
just	610.3	610.5
think	610.5	610.8
that	610.8	610.8
it	610.8	611.4
would	611.4	611.4
be	611.4	611.5
something	611.5	611.9
that	611.9	612.0
you	612.0	612.1
would	612.1	612.3
regret	612.3	612.4
every	612.4	613.0
single	613.0	613.2
day	613.2	613.4
for	613.4	613.5
the	613.5	613.6
rest	613.6	613.8
of	613.8	613.9
your	613.9	614.0
life.	614.0	614.2
So	617.4	617.8
however	617.8	618.1
hard	618.1	618.7
it	618.7	618.7
is	618.7	618.9
for	618.9	619.3
you	619.3	619.4
to	619.4	619.6
give	619.6	619.7
up.	619.7	619.8
This	619.8	620.0
puppy	620.0	620.5
would	620.5	621.8
be	621.8	621.9
like	621.9	622.1
a	622.1	622.2
million	622.2	622.5
times	622.5	622.7
harder	622.7	623.1
to	623.1	623.5
give	623.5	623.6
up	623.6	623.7
a	623.7	623.8
child.	623.8	624.0
Okay,	626.3	626.9
fair	626.9	627.7
enough.	627.7	627.7
Three	627.7	628.6
days.	628.6	628.9
Time	631.9	633.0
to	633.0	633.1
take	633.1	633.2
my	633.2	633.3
ass	633.3	633.7
out	633.7	633.8
of	633.8	633.9
the	633.9	634.0
killed.	634.0	634.5
Open	640.7	641.3
up	641.3	641.5
a	641.5	641.6
few	641.6	641.9
months.	641.9	642.1
Now,	642.1	642.3
I'm	642.3	643.0
saving	643.0	643.2
a	643.2	643.3
seat	643.3	643.5
for	643.5	643.7
my	643.7	643.8
friend,	643.8	644.0
Ross.	644.0	644.3
Only	644.3	652.9
two	652.9	653.0
people	653.0	653.3
in	653.3	653.3
the	653.3	653.4
