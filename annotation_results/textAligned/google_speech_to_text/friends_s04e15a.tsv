Okay,	307.2	308.1

to	308.3	308.4
talk.	308.4	308.5
I'm	310.9	311.4
just	311.4	311.6
getting	311.6	311.8
out	311.8	311.9
of	311.9	312.4
a	312.4	312.5
very	312.5	312.8
serious	312.8	313.1
relationship.	313.1	315.1
About	318.9	319.6
meant	319.6	320.2
to	320.2	320.5
be.	320.5	320.8
Bright.	322.2	322.8
But	322.8	323.8
I	323.8	323.9
just	323.9	324.1
think	324.1	324.3
this	324.3	324.4
is	324.4	324.6
happening	324.6	325.0
too	325.0	325.2
soon	325.2	325.3
to	325.3	326.4
say	326.4	326.8
when	326.8	327.0
I	327.0	329.7
said	329.7	329.9
honey,	329.9	330.3
I	330.3	330.5
am	330.5	330.7
not	330.7	330.8
letting	330.8	331.2
you	331.2	331.4
get	331.4	331.6
away	331.6	331.7
this	331.7	332.1
time.	332.1	332.2
But	337.4	338.8
unfortunately	338.8	340.4
my	340.4	341.4
company	341.4	341.9
is	341.9	343.1
transferring	343.1	343.4
me	343.4	343.7
overseas.	343.7	344.2
know	347.0	347.8
where	347.8	349.8
to	349.8	349.9
No,	351.7	353.2
no,	353.2	353.3
nope.	353.3	354.0
Not	354.0	354.2
Paris.	354.2	354.6
Barcelona.	357.7	359.2
Could	359.2	359.6
you	359.6	359.7
just	359.7	359.9
stop	359.9	360.1
talking	360.1	360.3
for	360.3	360.7
the	360.7	360.7
second?	360.7	361.1
Yemen.	364.4	365.0
That's	368.2	368.6
right.	368.6	368.9
Yes,	368.9	369.3
I'm	369.3	369.8
being	369.8	370.0
transferred	370.0	370.4
to	370.4	370.7
Yemen.	370.7	371.1
I	373.6	373.9
don't	373.9	374.1
know	374.1	374.3
exactly.	374.3	374.7
Moment.	383.1	383.8
But	386.6	387.0
I	387.0	387.1
do	387.1	387.3
know	387.3	387.4
it	387.4	387.5
sometime	387.5	387.9
tomorrow.	387.9	388.1
Done.	393.9	394.4
What's	396.5	397.8
up,	397.8	398.0
crazy?	398.0	400.4
So	400.4	401.2
I	401.2	401.5
turned	401.5	401.7
it	401.7	401.7
off	401.7	402.0
and	402.0	402.4
check	402.4	402.6
every	402.6	403.0
outlet	403.0	403.3
for	403.3	404.2
them	404.2	404.4
don't	404.4	404.5
work,	404.5	404.9
which	404.9	405.1
means,	405.1	405.5
one	405.5	405.7
of	405.7	405.8
them	405.8	406.2
has	406.2	406.5
to	406.5	406.7
be	406.7	406.7
controlled	406.7	407.0
by	407.0	407.1
the	407.1	407.3
switch.	407.3	407.6
So,	407.6	408.3
I	408.3	408.7
plugged	408.7	409.0
in	409.0	409.2
things,	409.2	409.3
then	409.3	409.9
all	409.9	410.1
for	410.1	410.3
Outlets	410.3	410.8
that	410.8	411.0
make	411.0	411.4
noise	411.4	411.6
that	411.6	411.9
way.	411.9	412.0
When	412.0	412.1
I	412.1	412.2
turn	412.2	412.4
it	412.4	412.4
on,	412.4	412.5
I	412.5	412.9
just	412.9	413.0
follow	413.0	413.3
the	413.3	413.4
noise	413.4	413.4
and	413.4	414.1
find	414.1	414.3
out	414.3	414.4
which	414.4	414.5
one	414.5	414.6
it	414.6	414.7
is,	414.7	414.8
but	414.8	417.4
it	417.4	417.6
stopped	417.6	417.8
listening	417.8	417.9
for	417.9	418.2
you	418.2	418.4
did.	418.4	418.5
You	420.2	420.5
don't,	420.5	420.8
you	420.8	420.9
also,	420.9	421.4
you	421.4	421.7
could	421.7	421.9
have	421.9	422.0
used	422.0	422.6
the	422.6	422.8
lamps	422.8	423.6
and	423.6	424.0
then	424.0	424.2
follow	424.2	424.4
the	424.4	424.7
light.	424.7	425.0
Yeah,	425.0	426.3
well	426.3	426.7
I'm	426.7	427.0
using	427.0	427.2
noise.	427.2	427.6
Here	427.6	433.1
we	433.1	433.2
go.	433.2	433.3
Something	436.4	437.7
I	437.7	438.3
hear	438.3	438.6
something.	438.6	438.9
Where	438.9	439.3

God.	455.4	455.9
That's	455.9	456.0
so	456.0	456.3
freaky.	456.3	456.9
Turn	456.9	457.2

Goes	460.9	461.4

Stanfield.	463.1	463.9
Hey,	466.0	466.4
honey.	466.4	467.0
On	467.0	467.8
the	467.8	467.9
news,	467.9	468.3
I	468.3	468.4
think	468.4	468.4
I	468.4	468.7
might	468.7	468.8
be	468.8	469.0
raining,	469.0	469.2
so	469.2	478.5
you're	478.5	478.6
not	478.6	478.7
even	478.7	478.9
man	478.9	479.2
enough	479.2	479.3
to	479.3	479.5
order	479.5	479.7
the	479.7	479.8
channel	479.8	480.2
that	480.2	480.3
carries	480.3	480.8
the	480.8	480.9
score.	480.9	481.3
You	492.0	492.3
