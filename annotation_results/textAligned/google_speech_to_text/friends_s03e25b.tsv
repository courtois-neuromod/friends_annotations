Tell	507.4	510.9
me	510.9	511.1
the	511.1	511.2
truth,	511.2	511.5
all	511.5	512.6
right.	512.6	512.8
The	514.1	514.5
man	514.5	514.9
in	514.9	515.0
that	515.0	515.2
picture	515.2	515.5

you're	536.6	537.4
right.	537.4	537.6

think	539.4	539.8
that	539.8	539.9
a	539.9	539.9
person	539.9	540.3
should	540.3	540.4
