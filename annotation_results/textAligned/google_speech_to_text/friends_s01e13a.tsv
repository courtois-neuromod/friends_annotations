I'm	427.0	427.1
not	427.1	427.2
showing	427.2	427.5
you	427.5	427.6
my	427.6	427.7
cat.	427.7	428.2
No.	432.4	432.8
Come	437.1	437.5
on	437.5	437.7
up	437.7	438.0
o.	438.0	438.5
Good	438.5	439.1
Rogers	439.1	440.2
here.	440.2	440.6
What's	442.5	442.9
the	442.9	443.0
matter	443.0	443.1
with	443.1	443.2
Rodger?	443.2	443.6
It's	443.6	444.3
nothing.	444.3	444.7
It's	444.7	444.7
a	444.7	444.8
little	444.8	445.1
thing.	445.1	445.2
I	445.2	445.6
hate	445.6	446.6
that	446.6	446.8
guy	446.8	447.2
was	447.2	449.7
a	449.7	449.7
little	449.7	450.1
analytical.	450.1	451.0
That's	451.0	451.2
what	451.2	451.4
he	451.4	451.5
does.	451.5	451.7
You	451.7	454.7
see,	454.7	454.8
that's	454.8	455.0
where	455.0	455.3
you're	455.3	455.3
wrong.	455.3	455.5
Why	455.5	456.4
would	456.4	456.6
I	456.6	456.7
marry	456.7	457.0
her?	457.0	457.4
If	457.4	457.6
I	457.6	457.7
thought	457.7	457.9
on	457.9	458.1
any	458.1	458.3
level	458.3	458.6
that	458.6	458.8
that	458.8	459.0
she	459.0	459.3
was	459.3	459.3
a	459.3	459.5
lesbian	459.5	459.6
Maybe	462.8	463.3
you	463.3	463.5
wanted	463.5	463.8
your	463.8	463.9
marriage	463.9	464.2
to	464.2	464.3
fail.	464.3	464.5
Why,	469.3	470.6
why	470.6	470.7
would	470.7	471.3
I	471.3	471.4
want?	471.4	471.8
Why?	471.8	472.3
I	474.2	474.4
don't	474.4	474.5
know,	474.5	474.7
maybe	474.7	475.0
maybe	475.0	476.8
low	476.8	477.1
self-esteem,	477.1	477.5
maybe,	477.5	478.7
maybe	478.7	479.5
to	479.5	479.6
compensate	479.6	480.3
for	480.3	480.4
overshadowing	480.4	481.2
a	481.2	481.3
sibling,	481.3	481.7
maybe	481.7	482.3
you.	482.3	482.4
I	485.3	486.5
don't	486.5	487.0
know.	487.0	487.1
It's	487.1	488.6
conceivable	488.6	489.4
that	489.4	490.2
you	490.2	490.4
wanted	490.4	490.7
to	490.7	490.8
sabotage	490.8	491.4
your	491.4	491.5
marriage	491.5	491.9
so	491.9	492.0
that	492.0	492.0
the	492.0	492.2
sibling	492.2	492.6
would	492.6	492.8
feel	492.8	493.3
like	493.3	493.4
less	493.4	493.7
of	493.7	493.7
a	493.7	493.8
failure	493.8	494.2
in	494.2	494.5
the	494.5	494.6
eyes	494.6	494.9
of	494.9	494.9
the	494.9	495.0
parents.	495.0	495.5
That's	496.7	499.9
ridiculous.	499.9	500.6
I	500.6	500.8
don't	500.8	500.8
feel	500.8	501.3
guilty	501.3	501.6
for	501.6	502.0
her	502.0	502.3
failure.	502.3	502.6
Think	506.7	507.0
I'm	507.0	507.1
a	507.1	507.2
failure.	507.2	507.6
Is	507.6	508.1
any	508.1	508.3
good?	508.3	508.4
I	508.4	511.6
married	511.6	519.3
a	519.3	519.4
lesbian	519.4	519.8
to	519.8	519.9
make	519.9	520.1
