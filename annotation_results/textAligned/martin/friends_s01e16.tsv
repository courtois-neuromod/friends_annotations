952.9	Didn't
953.0	I
953.2	memo
953.4	you
953.6	on

954.4	See,

955.6	go,
955.9	uh,
956.3	I
956.6	got
956.8	a
956.8	call
957.1	from
957.2	her
957.3	psychiatrist,
957.5	Dr.
957.7	Flanen...
959.6	...Dr.

962.7	And,
962.7	uh,
962.7	he
962.7	informed
964.2	me
964.4	that
964.6	she
965.3	took
965.4	the
965.5	news
965.7	rather
966.1	badly.
966.6	In
967.0	fact,
967.3	he,
967.6	uh,
967.9	mentioned
968.2	the
968.3	word
968.5	"""frenzy."""
970.5	You're
970.7	kidding.
970.9	She
971.1	seems
971.3	so...
972.1	Oh,
972.3	no,
972.5	no.
972.7	Nina?
972.9	She's:
975.8	In
976.3	fact,
976.7	if
976.8	you
977.0	asked
977.2	her
977.5	now...
978.3	...she'd
980.3	have
982.3	no
984.3	recollection
986.3	of
988.3	being
990.3	fired
992.3	at
994.3	all.
982.4	That's
982.6	unbelievable.
983.7	And
984.1	yet
984.3	believable.
986.2	So
986.5	I
986.7	decided
987.1	not
987.1	to
987.4	fire
987.6	her
987.7	again...
988.5	...until
988.5	I'm
988.5	sure
988.9	she

989.5	no
989.7	threat
990.0	to

992.8	I
993.0	see.
993.9	Hmm.
994.8	You

995.1	really
995.3	know
995.5	what's
995.8	going
995.8	on
996.0	inside
996.3	a
996.5	person's
996.8	head.
997.5	Well,
998.0	I
998.1	guess
998.3	that's
998.4	why
998.7	they
998.8	call
999.0	it
