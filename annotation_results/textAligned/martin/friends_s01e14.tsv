1022.2	something.
1023.3	Is

1029.0	Oh,

1032.5	"""Chan"
1032.7	and
1032.9	Jan

1035.6	I
1035.8	had
1036.0	them
1036.2	made
1036.4	special.
1041.5	Okay,
1041.7	Janice.
1043.8	Janice.
1046.5	Hey,
1046.7	Janice.
1050.9	Look,
1051.1	there's
1051.3	no
1051.5	way
1051.7	for
1051.9	me
1052.1	to
1052.3	tell
1052.5	you
1052.7	this.
1053.4	At
1053.6	least,
1053.8	there's
1054.0	no
1054.2	new
1054.4	way
1054.6	for
1054.8	me
1055.0	to
1055.2	tell
1055.4	you
1055.6	this.
1059.0	I
1059.2	just
1059.4	don't
1059.6	think
1059.8	things
1060.0	are
1060.2	gonna
1060.4	work
1060.6	out.
1064.5	That's
1064.7	fine.
1069.7	It
1069.9	is?
1070.1	Mm-hm.
1071.5	Because
1071.9	I
1072.4	know
1072.8	that
1073.2	this
1073.7	isn't
1074.1	the
1074.3	end.
1077.2	Oh,
1077.4	no.
1077.6	You
1077.8	see,
1078.0	actually,
1078.2	it
1078.4	is.
1079.9	No,
1080.1	it
1080.3	isn't.
1080.5	Because
1080.7	you
1080.9	won't
1081.1	let
1081.3	that
1081.5	happen.
1083.0	Don't
1083.2	you
1083.4	know
1083.6	it
1083.8	yet?
1084.7	You
1087.5	love
1087.7	me,
1087.9	Chandler
1088.1	Bing.
1092.1	Oh,
1092.2	no,
1092.4	I
1092.6	don't.
1094.4	Then
1094.6	why
1094.8	do
1095.0	you
1095.2	think
1095.4	we
1095.6	keep
1095.8	ending
1096.0	up
1096.2	together?
1097.4	New
1097.6	Year's,
1097.8	who
1098.0	invited
1098.2	who?
1099.5	Valentine's,
1099.7	who
1099.9	asked
1100.1	who
1100.3	into
1100.5	whose
1100.7	bed?
1102.6	I
1102.8	did,
1103.0	but...
1103.2	You
1103.4	seek
1103.6	me
1103.8	out.
1105.3	Something
1105.6	deep
1105.8	in
1106.1	your
1106.3	soul
1106.6	calls
1106.8	out
1107.1	to
1107.3	me
1107.5	like
1107.7	a
1107.9	foghorn.
1110.7	Janice.
1110.9	Janice.
1114.8	You
1115.0	want
1115.2	me.
1115.4	You
1115.6	need
1115.8	me.
1117.4	You
1117.6	can't
1117.8	live
1118.0	without
1118.2	me.
1120.9	And
1121.1	you
1121.3	know
1121.5	it.
1122.8	You
1123.0	just
1123.2	don't
1123.4	know
1123.6	you
1123.8	know
1124.0	it.
1131.1	See
1131.3	you.
1139.2	Call
1139.4	me.
1149.0	It's
1149.2	not
1149.4	true.
1149.6	I
1149.8	never
1150.0	called
1150.2	your
1150.4	mother
1150.6	a
1150.8	wolverine.
1154.2	You
1154.4	did
1154.6	so.
1154.8	I
1155.0	swear.
1155.2	I
1155.4	swear
1155.6	to...
1159.7	How
1159.9	long
1160.1	has
1160.3	she
1160.5	been
1160.7	in
1160.9	the
1161.1	bathroom?
1162.3	Uh,
1163.4	I
1163.6	don't
1163.8	think
1164.0	she's
1164.2	in
1164.4	the
1164.6	bathroom.
1164.8	Her
1165.0	coat
1165.2	is
1165.4	gone.
1166.5	Well,
1166.7	maybe
1166.9	it's
1167.1	cold
1167.3	in
1167.5	there.
1170.9	Maybe
1171.1	I
1171.3	screwed
1171.5	up
1171.7	the
1171.9	first
1172.1	date
1172.3	I
1172.5	had
1172.7	in
1172.9	nine
1173.1	years.
1174.3	That
1174.5	could
1174.7	be
1174.9	it.
1175.1	Oh,

1190.1	won't
1190.3	all
1190.5	be
1190.7	like
1190.9	this.
1191.1	Some
1191.3	might
1191.5	even
1191.7	stay
1191.9	through
1192.1	dinner.
1194.7	I'm
1194.9	sorry.
1195.1	That's
1195.3	not
1195.5	funny.
1195.7	No,
1195.9	it's
1196.1	just...
1198.1	Well,
