219.5	far
219.7	as
219.9	I'm
220.1	concerned...
220.9	...there

231.6	You
231.8	know
232.0	what
232.2	blows
232.4	my
232.6	mind?
233.4	Women
233.6	can
233.8	see
234.0	breasts
234.2	anytime
234.4	they
234.6	want.
238.9	You

239.3	look
239.5	down,
239.7	and
239.9	there
240.1	they

241.5	any
241.6	work
241.7	done
241.8	is
241.9	beyond

245.3	What
245.5	I
245.7	don't
245.9	get
246.1	is
246.3	the
246.5	way
246.7	guys

247.1	do
247.3	so
247.5	many
247.7	mean
247.9	things...
249.0	...and
249.2	then
249.4	not

322.5	No
322.7	plans,
322.9	huh?
323.1	Not
323.3	a
323.5	one.
325.9	Not
326.1	even,
326.3	say,
326.5	breaking

328.1	Oh,
328.3	right,
328.5	right.
328.7	Shut

332.2	Chandler,
332.4	nobody
332.6	likes
332.8	breaking
333.0	up
333.2	with
333.4	someone.
335.2	You
335.4	just
335.6	gotta
335.8	do
336.0	it.
336.2	I
336.4	know.
336.6	But
336.8	it's
337.0	just
337.2	so
337.4	hard.
339.0	You're
339.2	sitting
339.4	with
339.6	her.
339.8	She
340.0	has
340.2	no
340.4	idea
340.6	what's
340.8	happening.
342.3	You
342.5	finally
342.7	get
342.9	up
343.1	the
343.3	courage
343.5	to
343.7	do
343.9	it.
345.0	There's
345.2	that
345.4	awkward
345.6	moment
345.8	when
346.0	you've
346.2	handed
346.4	her
346.6	the
346.8	note.
352.0	Why

354.5	have
354.7	to
354.9	break
355.1	up
355.3	with
355.5	her?
355.9	Be
356.1	a
356.3	man.
356.5	Just
356.7	stop
356.9	calling.
359.6	If
359.8	you
360.0	want,
360.2	I'll
360.4	do
360.6	it
360.8	with
361.0	you.
362.2	Thanks,
362.4	but
362.6	she'd
362.8	feel
363.0	like
363.2	we
363.4	were
363.6	ganging
363.8	up
364.0	on
364.2	her.
365.7	I

366.3	break
366.5	up
366.7	with
366.9	Janice.
367.1	I'll
367.3	break
367.5	up
367.7	with
367.9	Tony.
368.6	You're
368.8	breaking

369.4	Tony?
370.3	I
370.5	know.
370.7	He's
