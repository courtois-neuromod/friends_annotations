26.3	There's
26.5	nothing
26.7	to
26.9	tell.
27.1	It's
27.3	just
27.5	some
27.7	guy
27.9	I
28.1	work
28.3	with.
29.3	Come
29.5	on.
29.7	You're
29.9	going
30.1	out
30.3	with
30.5	a
30.7	guy.
31.6	There's
31.8	gotta
32.0	be
32.2	something
32.4	wrong
32.6	with
32.8	him.
34.4	So
34.6	does
34.8	he
35.0	have
35.2	a
35.4	hump
35.6	and
35.8	a
36.0	hair
36.2	piece?
38.7	Wait.
38.9	Does
39.1	he
39.3	eat
39.5	chalk?
41.4	I
41.6	don't
41.8	want
42.0	her

42.6	through
42.8	what
43.0	I
43.2	went
43.4	through
43.6	with
43.8	Carl.
44.0	Oh.
44.8	Okay,
45.0	everybody
45.2	relax.
45.4	This
45.6	is
45.8	not
46.0	even
46.2	a
46.4	date.
47.8	It's
48.0	just
48.2	two
48.4	people
48.6	going
48.8	out
49.0	to
49.2	dinner
49.4	and
49.6	not
49.8	having
50.0	sex.
51.0	Sounds
51.2	like
51.4	a
51.6	date
51.8	to
52.0	me.
55.4	I'm
55.6	back
55.8	in
56.0	high
56.2	school,
56.4	in
56.6	the
56.8	middle
57.0	of
57.2	the
57.4	cafeteria...
58.4	...and
58.6	I
58.8	realize
59.0	I'm
59.2	totally
59.4	naked.
62.0	Oh,
62.2	yeah.
62.4	I've
62.6	had
62.8	that
63.0	dream.
63.7	Then
63.9	I
64.1	look
64.3	down
64.5	and
64.7	I
64.9	realize
65.1	there
65.3	is
65.5	a
65.7	phone...
68.4	...there.
71.3	Instead
71.5	of...
71.7	That's
71.9	right!
73.4	No.
75.1	All
75.3	of
75.5	a
75.7	sudden,
75.9	the
76.1	phone
76.3	starts
76.5	to
76.7	ring.
79.4	And
79.6	it
79.8	turns
80.0	out
80.2	it's
80.4	my
80.6	mother.
82.9	Which
83.4	is
83.9	very,
84.3	very
84.8	weird
85.3	because
85.8	she
86.2	never
86.7	calls
87.2	me.
92.2	Hi.
95.1	This

99.2	sweetie?
100.0	I
100.2	feel

100.6	someone
100.8	grabbed
101.0	my
101.2	small
101.4	intestine,
101.6	pulled
101.8	it
102.0	out
102.2	of
102.4	my
102.6	mouth...
104.8	...and
105.0	tied
105.2	it
105.4	around
105.6	my
105.8	neck.
106.0	Cookie?
109.7	Carol

129.3	I
129.5	hope
129.7	she'll

135.5	And
135.7	you
135.9	never
136.1	knew
136.3	she

141.5	No!
141.7	Okay?
143.9	Why

144.5	keep
144.7	fixating
144.9	on
145.1	that?
148.3	She
148.5	didn't
148.7	know.
148.9	How

227.5	bridesmaids?
230.7	Oh,
230.8	God!
231.0	Well,
231.1	it
231.3	started
231.4	about
231.6	a
231.8	half-hour
232.0	before
232.2	the
232.4	wedding.
236.1	I
236.2	was
236.2	in
236.3	this
236.3	room
236.4	with
236.4	all
236.5	the
236.7	presents...
238.4	...and
238.6	I
238.8	was
239.0	looking
239.2	at
239.4	this
239.6	gravy
239.8	boat.
240.5	This
240.7	really
240.9	gorgeous
241.1	Limoges
241.3	gravy
241.5	boat.
244.1	When
244.3	all
244.5	of
244.7	a
244.9	sudden...
245.1	Sweet
245.3	'N
245.5	Low?
246.1	I
246.3	realized...
248.4	...I
248.6	was
248.8	more
249.0	turned
249.2	on
249.4	by
249.6	this
249.8	gravy
250.0	boat
250.2	than
250.4	by
250.6	Barry.
252.4	Then
252.6	I
252.8	got
253.0	really
253.2	freaked
253.4	out,
253.6	and
253.8	that's
254.0	when
254.2	it
254.4	hit
254.6	me:
255.7	How
255.9	much
256.1	Barry
256.3	looks
256.5	like
256.7	Mr.
256.9	Potato
257.1	Head.
258.9	You
259.1	know,
259.3	I
259.5	mean,
259.7	I
259.9	always
260.1	knew
260.3	he
260.5	looked
260.7	familiar,
260.9	but...
264.3	Anyway,
264.5	I
264.7	just
264.9	had
265.1	to
265.3	get
265.5	out
265.7	of
265.9	there,
266.1	and
266.3	I
266.5	started
266.7	wondering:
267.9	"""Why"
268.1	am
268.3	I
268.5	doing
268.7	"this?"""
268.9	And
269.1	"""Who"
269.3	am
269.5	I
269.7	doing
269.9	this
270.1	"for?"""
271.6	Anyway,
271.8	I
272.0	just
272.2	didn't
272.4	know
272.6	where
272.8	to
273.0	go,
273.2	and
273.4	I
273.6	know
273.8	you
274.0	and
274.2	I
274.4	have
274.6	drifted
274.8	apart...
276.2	...but
276.4	you're
276.6	the
276.8	only
277.0	person
277.2	I
277.4	know
277.6	in
277.8	the
278.0	city.
279.3	Who
279.5	wasn't
279.7	invited
279.9	to
280.1	the
280.3	wedding.
281.3	Oh,
281.5	I
281.7	was
281.9	kind
282.1	of
282.3	hoping
282.5	that
282.7	wouldn't
282.9	be
283.1	an
283.3	issue.
291.5	[SPEAKING
291.7	IN

311.3	I
311.5	just

312.1	him.
313.2	Well,
313.4	it
313.6	matters
313.8	to
314.0	me.
318.3	She
318.5	should
318.7	not
318.9	be
319.1	wearing
319.3	those
319.5	pants.
321.9	I
322.1	say
