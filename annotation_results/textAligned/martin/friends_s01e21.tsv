209.3	you
209.5	are
209.7	not
209.9	still
210.1	going

210.5	that
210.7	thing.
210.8	This
211.0	woman's
211.2	living
211.4	my
211.6	life.
211.8	What?
214.1	She's
214.3	living
214.5	my
214.7	life,
214.9	and
215.1	she's
215.3	doing
215.5	it
215.7	better
215.9	than
216.1	me.
218.2	Look
218.4	at
218.6	this.
218.8	Look.
220.4	She
220.6	buys

223.2	She
223.4	shops
223.6	at
223.8	stores
224.0	that
224.2	I'm
224.4	intimidated
224.6	by
224.8	the
225.0	salespeople.
227.6	She
227.8	spent
228.0	$300
228.2	on
228.4	art
228.6	supplies.
229.5	You're
229.7	not
229.9	an
230.1	artist.
231.0	Yeah,
231.2	well,
231.4	I
231.6	might
231.8	be
232.0	if
232.2	I
232.4	had
232.6	the
232.8	supplies.
234.8	I
235.0	mean,
235.2	I
235.4	could
235.6	do
235.8	all
236.0	this
236.2	stuff.
236.4	Only
236.6	I
236.8	don't.
239.6	Oh,
239.8	Monica,
240.0	come
240.2	on.
240.4	You
240.6	do
240.8	cool
241.0	things.
242.2	Oh,
242.4	really?
242.6	Let's
242.8	compare,
243.0	shall
243.2	we?
244.6	Oh,
244.8	it's
245.0	so
245.2	late
245.4	for
245.6	"""shall"
245.8	"we?"""
248.7	Do
248.9	I
249.1	go
249.3	horseback
249.5	riding
249.7	in
249.9	the
250.1	park,
250.3	hmm?
251.3	Do
251.5	I
251.7	take
251.9	classes
252.1	at
252.3	The
252.5	New
252.7	School?
253.4	No.
253.6	No.
256.0	This
256.2	is
256.4	so
256.6	unfair.
257.5	She's
257.7	got
257.9	everything
258.1	I
258.3	want,
258.5	and
258.7	she

269.3	How
269.5	about
269.7	Joey
269.9	Paponi?
271.7	No,
271.8	still
271.8	too
271.9	ethnic.
272.0	My
272.0	agent
272.1	thinks
272.2	I
272.3	should
272.3	have
272.4	a
273.4	name
274.5	that's
275.5	more
275.7	neutral.
276.1	Joey
276.3	Switzerland?
282.8	Plus
283.0	I
283.2	think
283.4	it
283.6	should
283.8	be
284.0	Joe.
284.2	Joey
284.4	makes
284.6	me
284.8	sound
285.0	like
285.2	I'm...
287.3	...this
287.5	big.
288.7	Which
288.9	I'm
289.1	not!

301.1	That
301.3	sounds
301.5	familiar.
302.8	Well,
303.0	it
303.2	does
303.4	not
303.6	ring
303.8	a
304.0	bell
304.2	with
304.4	me.
304.6	Huh.
306.5	Joe
306.7	Stalin.
312.0	You
312.2	know,
312.4	that's
312.6	pretty
312.8	good.
314.5	You
314.7	might
314.9	want
315.1	to
315.3	try
315.5	Joseph.
315.7	Ah!
322.9	Joseph
323.1	Stalin!

584.3	start
584.5	getting
584.7	aggressive
584.9	and
585.1	violent.
588.1	What
588.3	does
588.5	this
588.7	mean?
591.9	I
592.1	have
592.3	to
592.5	give
592.7	him
592.9	up.
610.5	I
610.7	can't
610.9	believe
611.1	it.
611.3	This
611.5	sucks!
613.8	You
615.8	just
617.8	got
619.8	him.
621.8	How
623.8	could
625.8	he
627.8	be
629.8	an
631.8	adult
633.8	already?
617.4	I
617.6	know,
617.8	I
618.0	know.
618.2	One
618.4	day
618.6	he's
618.8	this
619.0	little
619.2	thing...
620.9	...and
621.1	before
621.3	you
621.5	know
621.7	it,
621.9	he's
622.1	this
622.3	little
622.5	thing...
623.6	...I
623.8	can't
624.0	get
624.2	off
624.4	my
624.6	leg.
627.6	Isn't
627.6	there
627.7	any
627.8	way
627.8	you
628.0	can
628.2	keep
628.4	him?
629.6	No.
629.8	No.
630.8	The
631.0	vet
631.2	said
631.4	that
631.6	unless
631.8	he's
632.0	in
632.2	a
632.4	place
632.6	where
632.8	he
633.0	has
633.2	regular
633.4	access...
634.8	...to
635.0	some
635.2	monkey
635.4	loving...
640.1	...he's
640.3	just
640.5	gonna
640.7	get
640.9	vicious.
642.3	I
642.5	just
642.7	gotta
642.9	get
643.1	him
643.3	into
643.5	a
643.7	zoo.
647.0	How
647.2	do
647.4	you
647.6	get
647.8	a
648.0	monkey
648.2	into
648.4	a
648.6	zoo?
648.8	I
649.0	know
649.2	that
649.4	one!
654.3	No,
654.5	that's
654.7	popes
654.9	into
655.1	a
655.3	Volkswagen.
658.8	We're
659.0	applying
659.2	to
659.4	a
659.6	lot
659.8	of
660.0	them.
660.2	Our
660.4	first
660.6	choice
660.8	would
661.0	be
661.2	a
661.4	state
661.6	zoo.
663.4	You
663.6	know,
663.8	like,
664.0	uh,
664.2	San
664.4	Diego.
666.7	Right?
668.5	But
668.7	that
668.9	may
669.1	just
669.3	be
669.5	a
669.7	pipe
669.9	dream
670.1	because
670.3	he's
670.5	out-of-state.
675.1	My
675.3	vet
675.5	knows
675.7	someone
675.9	at
676.1	Miami,
676.3	so
676.5	that's
676.7	a
676.9	possibility.
679.6	But
679.8	that's
680.0	two
680.2	blocks
680.4	from
680.6	the
680.8	beach.
681.0	It's
681.2	a
681.4	total
681.6	party
681.8	zoo.
687.9	Hey.
689.1	Hi.
689.3	We
689.5	found
689.7	the
689.9	girl!
691.1	What?
691.3	Did
691.5	you
691.7	call
691.9	the
692.1	cops?
692.9	Nope.
693.1	We
693.3	took
693.5	her
693.7	to
693.9	lunch.
694.6	Ah.
694.8	Your
695.0	own
695.2	brand
695.4	of
695.6	vigilante
695.8	justice.
699.1	Are
699.3	you
699.5	insane?
699.7	This
699.9	woman
700.1	stole
700.3	from
700.5	you!
701.9	She
702.1	stole!
702.3	She's
702.5	a
702.7	stealer!
705.2	After
705.4	you're
705.6	with
705.8	this
706.0	woman
706.2	for
706.4	10
706.6	minutes,
706.8	you

707.2	all
707.4	that.
710.4	I
710.6	mean,
710.8	she's

713.4	amazing
713.6	spirit!
715.4	Yeah,
715.6	which
715.8	she
716.0	probably
716.2	stole
716.4	from
716.6	some
716.8	cheerleader!
720.8	Take
721.0	off
721.2	their
721.4	hats.
721.6	Popes
721.8	in
722.0	a
722.2	Volkswagen!
723.3	Mm-hm.
726.5	I
726.7	love
726.9	that
727.1	joke.
731.8	No
732.0	way!
732.2	No
732.4	way
732.6	did
732.8	you
733.0	do
733.2	this!
733.4	Monana
733.6	was
733.8	very
734.0	brave.
737.7	It
737.9	was
738.1	so
738.3	wild.
739.1	We
739.3	told
739.5	them
739.7	we
739.9	were
740.1	the
740.3	Gunnersons
740.5	in
740.7	room
740.9	615...
742.2	...only
743.0	to
743.2	find
743.4	out
743.6	the
743.8	Boston
744.0	Celtics
744.2	had
744.4	the
744.6	entire
744.8	sixth
745.0	floor!
746.2	So
746.4	when
746.6	they
746.8	caught
747.0	on
747.2	to
747.4	the
747.6	fact
747.8	that
748.0	we're
748.2	short
748.4	and
748.6	have
748.8	breasts...
750.2	They
750.4	threw
750.6	us
750.8	out.
751.0	I
751.2	was
751.4	thrown
751.6	out
751.8	of
752.0	a
752.2	hotel!
752.4	Me!
754.1	Go,
754.3	Monana!
758.2	Well,
758.4	you
758.6	ladies

759.2	the
759.4	only
759.6	ones
759.8	living
760.0	the

762.5	to
762.7	go
762.9	pour
763.1	coffee
763.3	for
763.5	people
763.7	I
763.9	don't
764.1	know.
764.3	Don't
764.5	wait
764.7	up.
768.4	Oh,
768.6	by
768.8	the
769.0	way...
770.5	...tomorrow
770.7	we're
770.9	auditioning

775.2	Excuse
775.4	me?
776.4	There's
776.6	an
776.8	open
777.0	call
777.2	for
777.4	Cats.
778.3	I'm
778.3	thinking
778.4	we
778.6	go
778.8	down
779.0	there,
779.2	sing
779.4	"""Memories""..."
781.3	...and
781.5	make
781.7	complete
781.9	fools
782.1	of
782.3	ourselves.
782.5	What
782.7	do
782.9	you
783.1	say?
785.1	No,
785.3	no,
785.5	no.
787.6	Remember
787.8	who
788.0	you're
788.2	dealing
788.4	with
788.6	here.
788.8	Ha.
790.4	I'm
792.4	not
794.4	like
796.4	you.
798.4	I
800.4	can't
802.4	even
804.4	stand
806.4	in
808.4	front
810.4	of
812.4	a
814.4	tap
816.4	class.
793.8	That's
794.0	because
794.2	of
794.4	your
794.6	Amish
794.8	background.
798.1	What?
798.3	Well,
798.5	you're
798.7	Pennsylvania
798.9	Dutch,
799.1	right?
801.0	Right.
802.3	Till
802.5	I
802.7	bought
802.9	a
803.1	blow
803.3	dryer.
803.5	Then
803.7	I
803.9	was
804.1	shunned.
807.6	I
807.8	was
808.0	just
808.2	like
808.4	you.
809.2	And
809.3	then
809.5	one
809.6	day,
809.7	I
810.5	saw
811.2	a
811.4	movie
811.6	that
811.8	changed
812.0	my
812.2	life.
813.8	Did
814.0	you
814.2	ever
814.4	see
814.6	Dead
814.8	Poets
815.0	Society?
815.2	Uh-huh.
816.4	I
817.5	thought
817.7	that
817.9	movie
818.1	was
818.3	so
818.5	incredibly...
820.3	...boring!
821.9	I
823.9	mean,
825.9	that
827.9	thing
829.9	at
831.9	the
833.9	end
835.9	where
837.9	the
839.9	kid...
824.2	...kills
824.3	himself
824.5	because
824.6	he
824.7	can't
824.8	be
825.0	in
825.1	the
825.3	play?
827.6	What
827.8	was
828.0	that?
829.1	It's
829.3	like,
829.5	"""Kid,"
829.7	wait
829.9	a
830.1	year.
830.3	Leave
830.5	home,
830.7	do
830.9	some
831.1	community
831.3	"theater!"""
835.9	I
836.1	walked
836.3	out
836.5	of
836.7	there,
836.9	and
837.1	I
837.3	thought:
837.9	"""Now,"
838.1	that's
838.3	two
838.5	hours
838.7	of
838.9	my

839.3	that
839.5	I'm
839.7	never
839.9	getting
840.1	"back!"""
842.5	And
842.7	that
842.9	scared
843.1	me
843.3	more
843.5	than
843.7	all
843.9	the
844.1	other
844.3	crap
844.5	I
844.7	was
844.9	afraid
845.1	to
845.3	do.
846.9	Wow.
848.2	Then
848.4	I
848.6	would
848.8	definitely
849.0	not
849.2	recommend
849.4	Mrs.
849.6	Doubtfire.
850.6	[LAUGHING]
858.3	Oh,
858.5	God.
861.5	We
861.7	didn't
861.9	get
862.1	into
862.3	Scranton.
865.8	That
866.0	was
866.2	our
866.4	safety

869.4	They
869.6	take,
869.8	like,
870.0	dogs
870.2	and
870.4	cows.
874.9	See?
876.4	I
876.6	don't
876.8	know
877.0	who
877.2	this
877.4	is
877.6	harder
877.8	on,
878.0	me
878.2	or
878.4	him.
880.7	I'd
880.9	say
881.1	that
881.3	chair's
881.5	taking
881.7	the
881.9	brunt

887.7	Marcel,
887.9	no.
890.6	Good

892.4	See?
892.6	How
892.8	can
893.0	nobody

894.6	Somebody
894.8	will.

907.4	You're
907.6	kidding!
909.9	Apparently,
910.1	he
910.3	was
910.5	this

911.1	who
911.3	slaughtered
911.5	all

917.1	You'd
917.3	think

939.0	Well,
939.2	it's
939.4	technically
939.6	not
939.8	a

945.6	Let

953.2	No,
953.4	no.
953.6	He's
953.8	very

955.4	Hmm.
955.6	Even
955.8	if
956.0	he

956.4	cornered?
961.7	Well,
961.9	I
962.1	don't

962.5	Why?
964.4	Um,
964.6	how
964.8	is
