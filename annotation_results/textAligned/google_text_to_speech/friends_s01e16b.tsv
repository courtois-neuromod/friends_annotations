Good	205.4	207.2
night	207.2	207.4
memo.	207.4	207.6
You	207.6	207.8
on	207.8	207.9
this.	207.9	208.1
See	208.1	208.8
after	208.8	209.3
I	209.3	209.4
let	209.4	209.5
her	209.5	209.7
go.	209.7	210.0
I	210.0	210.6
got	210.6	210.9
a	210.9	210.9
call	210.9	211.2
from	211.2	211.3
her	211.3	211.4
psychiatrist	211.4	211.8
doctor	211.8	212.5
flying	212.5	212.7
and	212.7	213.0
then	213.0	213.4
dr.	213.4	214.1
Flint	214.1	215.4
and	215.4	216.8
he	216.8	217.8
informed	217.8	218.4
me	218.4	218.4
that	218.4	218.7
she	218.7	219.4
took	219.4	219.5
the	219.5	219.7
news	219.7	219.8
rather	219.8	220.2
badly.	220.2	220.6
In	220.6	221.1
fact,	221.1	221.4
he,	221.4	221.5
he	221.5	221.6
mentioned	221.6	222.4
the	222.4	222.4
word	222.4	222.6
frenzy	222.6	223.1
Nita,	223.1	226.8
she	226.8	227.1
is	227.1	227.2
we,	227.2	227.4
we	227.4	227.5
we,	227.5	227.7
in	227.7	230.3
fact,	230.3	230.7
if	230.7	230.8
you	230.8	231.0
ask	231.0	231.3
her	231.3	231.4
right	231.4	231.6
now,	231.6	231.7
she	231.7	232.1
would	232.1	232.2
have	232.2	232.4
no	232.4	232.7
recollection	232.7	233.0
of	233.0	233.4
being	233.4	233.5
fired	233.5	234.1
at	234.1	234.2
all.	234.2	234.5
Not	234.5	234.7
at	234.7	234.8
all.	234.8	235.1
That's	235.1	236.9
unbelievable	236.9	237.4
believable.	237.4	239.0
So,	239.0	240.6
I	240.6	240.8
decided	240.8	241.2
not	241.2	241.2
to	241.2	241.4
fire	241.4	241.7
her	241.7	241.8
again	241.8	242.1
until	242.1	242.4
I	242.4	242.5
can	242.5	242.6
be	242.6	242.7
sure	242.7	242.8
that	242.8	243.2
you	243.2	243.4
will	243.4	243.5
be	243.5	243.6
no	243.6	243.9
threat	243.9	244.1
to	244.1	244.3
herself	244.3	244.5
or	244.5	245.0
others.	245.0	245.3
I	246.8	247.1
see,	247.1	247.3
I	247.3	248.7
guess	248.7	248.9
you	248.9	249.0
never	249.0	249.2
really	249.2	249.4
know	249.4	249.6
what's	249.6	249.9
going	249.9	249.9
on	249.9	250.2
inside	250.2	250.4
a	250.4	250.6
person's	250.6	250.9
head.	250.9	251.1
Well	251.1	252.0
I	252.0	252.1
guess	252.1	252.4
that's	252.4	252.7
why	252.7	252.7
they	252.7	252.9
call	252.9	253.1
it	253.1	253.3
psychology	253.3	254.1
sir.	254.1	254.3
Sound	258.0	258.9
mom	258.9	259.2
and	259.2	259.4
dad	259.4	259.7
ever	259.7	260.3
for	260.3	260.5
kids.	260.5	260.8
Susan,	270.4	272.3
go	272.3	272.5
deep.	272.5	272.7
What	281.8	282.1
is	282.1	282.2
Honey	282.2	282.5
woman	282.5	284.2
did?	284.2	285.6
I	287.2	287.5
am	287.5	287.7
not	287.7	288.3
doing	288.3	288.7
that,	288.7	288.9
he's	288.9	290.5
going	290.5	290.6
to	290.6	290.7
have	290.7	290.9
to	290.9	291.0
stay	291.0	291.3
and	291.3	291.6
that's	291.6	291.9
all	291.9	292.0
everything.	292.0	292.5
Over	292.5	292.9
the	292.9	293.0
same	293.0	293.5
it'll	293.5	293.9
just	293.9	294.1
stay	294.1	294.4
in	294.4	294.9
someone's	294.9	299.9
going	299.9	300.2
up	300.2	300.3
to	300.3	300.4
you	300.4	300.6
and	300.6	300.7
say	300.7	300.8

your	301.6	301.8
nostril?	301.8	302.3
I	310.8	311.3
know	311.3	311.6
it's	311.6	311.8
frightening	311.8	312.3
but	312.3	312.8
big	312.8	313.3
picture.	313.3	313.8
The	313.8	314.7
birth	314.7	314.9
part	314.9	315.2
is	315.2	315.6
just	315.6	315.8
one	315.8	316.2
day	316.2	316.5
and	316.5	317.4
when	317.4	317.6
it's	317.6	317.7
over,	317.7	317.8
we're	317.8	318.7
all	318.7	318.9
going	318.9	319.1
to	319.1	319.2
be	319.2	319.3
parents	319.3	319.6
for	319.6	320.0
the	320.0	320.1
rest	320.1	320.4
of	320.4	320.5
our	320.5	320.7
lives.	320.7	320.8
I	320.8	322.2
mean,	322.2	322.4
that's	322.4	322.5
what	322.5	322.7
this	322.7	322.8
is	322.8	322.9
all	322.9	323.1
about,	323.1	323.1

having	334.5	334.8
a	334.8	334.9
baby.	334.9	335.0
I	335.0	335.3
just	335.3	335.4
never	335.4	335.7
realized	335.7	336.0
the	336.0	336.4
baby	336.4	336.8
was	336.8	337.0
having	337.0	337.5

Can	341.5	341.7
you	341.7	341.8
say	341.8	342.0
that?	342.0	342.2
I	342.2	342.5
can't	342.5	342.7
even	342.7	342.8
get	342.8	342.9

now	350.2	350.4
saying	350.4	350.5

monkeys	351.3	351.8
and	351.8	351.9
babies	351.9	352.4
are	352.4	352.5
actually	352.5	353.0
different.	353.0	353.1
You	357.8	358.2
might	358.2	358.4
want	358.4	358.6
to	358.6	358.6
look	358.6	358.7
into	358.7	358.9
it.	358.9	359.2
Yes.	365.1	365.6
I	366.8	367.2
can	367.2	367.5
I	367.5	367.5
just	367.5	367.6
ask	367.6	367.9
you	367.9	368.0
one	368.0	368.2
question.	368.2	368.4
have	370.0	370.4
YouTube,	370.4	370.9
you	370.9	371.2

You	374.4	374.8

Yes.	376.7	377.2
Well,	378.6	379.1
not	379.1	379.3
that.	379.3	379.3
It's	379.3	379.5
any	379.5	379.6
