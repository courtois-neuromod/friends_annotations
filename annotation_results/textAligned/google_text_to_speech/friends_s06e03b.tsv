Nothing	36.4	36.7

I	144.7	147.2
can	147.2	147.3
handle	147.3	147.6
this	147.6	147.8
apparently	147.8	149.0
not	149.0	149.4

of	296.4	296.5
our	296.5	296.6
history.	296.6	296.7
It	300.9	302.8
would	302.8	303.0
be	303.0	303.1
weird	303.1	303.3
if	303.3	303.6
we	303.6	303.9
were	303.9	304.2
still	304.2	304.4
in	304.4	304.8

place?	308.1	308.7
It's	313.1	313.6
not	313.6	313.8
a	313.8	313.9
problem.	313.9	314.2
I	314.2	314.9

it's	336.9	337.2
going	337.2	337.3
to	337.3	337.4
be	337.4	337.4

be	339.9	340.0
like	340.0	340.2
in	340.2	340.3
college	340.3	340.7
I'll	340.7	341.3

the	341.8	342.1
door	342.1	342.3
and	342.3	342.4
put	342.4	342.5
a	342.5	342.6
sign.	342.6	342.8
Come	342.8	343.5

later	343.8	344.3
I'm	344.3	344.5
Get	344.5	344.7
Lucky.	344.7	345.2
I	358.8	359.3
mean	359.3	360.9
it's	360.9	361.0
a	361.0	361.1
really	361.1	361.4
big	361.4	362.0
step	362.0	362.3
and	362.3	362.6
then,	362.6	362.9
what's	362.9	363.7
the	363.7	363.8
rush?	363.8	363.9
You	369.3	371.0
think	371.0	371.3
silly?	371.3	371.6
Because	371.6	372.0
he	372.0	372.2
knows	372.2	372.4
that	372.4	372.5
we	372.5	372.6
enjoy	372.6	372.7
the	372.7	373.0
silliness.	373.0	373.4
No	375.4	375.8
I'm	375.8	376.0
serious.	376.0	376.8
Okay,	376.8	377.5
I	377.5	377.6
mean	377.6	377.8
think	377.8	378.1
about	378.1	378.2
it,	378.2	378.6
you	378.6	379.1
move	379.1	379.4
in,	379.4	379.7
you	379.7	380.5
start	380.5	380.9
fighting	380.9	381.3
over	381.3	381.9
stupid	381.9	382.4
game	382.4	383.0
rooms.	383.0	383.6
Next	383.6	383.8
thing	383.8	384.1
you	384.1	384.2
know	384.2	384.3
you'll	384.3	384.6
break	384.6	384.8
up	384.8	385.2
Before	386.5	386.9
it	386.9	387.0
was	387.0	387.1
just	387.1	387.2
a	387.2	387.3
stupid	387.3	387.6
stupid.	387.6	389.8
You're	391.3	391.8
talking	391.8	392.1
about	392.1	392.2
the	392.2	393.1
room,	393.1	393.8
this	393.8	394.3
is	394.3	394.5
about	394.5	394.7
what	394.7	394.9
the	394.9	395.0
room	395.0	395.6
represents	395.6	397.3
and	397.3	398.1
unfortunately	398.1	398.9
that's	398.9	399.5
wrong	399.5	400.1
to	400.1	400.4
destroy.	400.4	400.7
You	400.7	401.2
know,	401.2	404.6
me	404.6	404.8
neither,	404.8	404.9
I	406.1	406.5
just	406.5	409.5
want	409.5	409.7
to	409.7	409.8
see	409.8	409.9
you	409.9	410.0
guys	410.0	410.2
break	410.2	410.5
up.	410.5	410.7
Do	410.7	412.5
if	412.5	413.0
you	413.0	413.2
move	413.2	413.6
in	413.6	414.0
together?	414.0	414.5
What?	417.7	418.1
That's	418.1	418.4
what	418.4	418.5
you	418.5	418.7
want.	418.7	418.9
There's	418.9	419.1
nothing	419.1	419.4
I	419.4	419.4
can	419.4	419.7
do.	419.7	419.8
You	427.7	428.0
still	428.0	428.2
want	428.2	428.4
to	428.4	428.4
move	428.4	428.5
in	428.5	428.6
together,	428.6	428.8
right?	428.8	429.2
Of	429.2	429.6
course,	429.6	429.9
Boston	429.9	431.0
scare	431.0	431.4
you.	431.4	431.5
Oh	441.2	441.6
my	441.6	441.8
God.	441.8	442.2
Someone	442.2	442.5
killed	442.5	442.9
Square,	442.9	443.2
man.	443.2	443.5
I	446.5	446.7
thought	446.7	446.9
they	446.9	447.0
could	447.0	447.7
go.	447.7	447.9
And	449.7	450.1
still	450.1	450.6
is	450.6	450.8
walking	450.8	451.2
distance	451.2	451.5
to	451.5	451.6
the	451.6	451.6
kitchen	451.6	452.0
that	452.0	462.6
we	462.6	462.7
can	462.7	462.8
get	462.8	462.9
one	462.9	463.2
of	463.2	463.2
those	463.2	463.4
sign	463.4	463.8
and	463.8	464.0
hang	464.0	464.2
it	464.2	464.3
over	464.3	464.4
our	464.4	464.7
bed.	464.7	465.0
Because	467.3	467.9
that's	467.9	468.2
you.	468.2	468.4
And	468.4	468.5
I	468.5	468.7
together.	468.7	469.1
Merge.	470.3	471.1
I	480.1	480.4
found	480.4	481.1
you	481.1	481.4
in	481.4	481.6
my	481.6	481.9
bed.	481.9	483.1
How	483.1	484.0
do	484.0	484.4
I	484.4	484.7
end	484.7	485.0
up	485.0	485.1
there?	485.1	485.3
Now,	507.8	508.8
if	508.8	509.1
you	509.1	509.3
want	509.3	509.5
to	509.5	509.6
receive	509.6	509.9
emails	509.9	510.6
about	510.6	510.8
my	510.8	510.9
upcoming	510.9	511.1
shows,	511.1	511.9
then	511.9	512.1
please	512.1	512.5
give	512.5	512.8
me	512.8	512.8
money.	512.8	513.1
So	513.1	513.3
I	513.3	513.4
can	513.4	513.6
buy	513.6	513.6
a	513.6	513.8
computer.	513.8	514.1
So	518.8	519.2
huh,	519.2	519.5
where	519.5	521.0
the	521.0	521.1
other	521.1	521.3
guys?	521.3	521.5
No,	525.1	526.5
the	526.5	526.7
other	526.7	526.8
thing.	526.8	527.1
I	528.8	529.0
think	529.0	529.4
it's	529.4	529.6
great.	529.6	529.7
They	529.7	529.9
work	529.9	530.1
things	530.1	530.2
out	530.2	530.5
there.	530.5	533.1
For	535.0	535.3
the	535.3	535.4
key	535.4	535.5
to	535.5	535.6
your	535.6	535.7
house.	535.7	535.9
So	535.9	536.0
I	536.0	536.0
can	536.0	536.2
run	536.2	536.3
across	536.3	536.4
the	536.4	536.6
street	536.6	536.6
next	536.6	536.9
to	536.9	537.1
nothing.	537.1	537.3
Now,	540.7	541.1
are	541.1	541.3
you	541.3	541.5
sure?	541.5	541.9
Because	541.9	542.3
once	542.3	542.7
I	542.7	542.9
make	542.9	543.1
a	543.1	543.2
copy,	543.2	543.5
there's	543.5	544.0
no	544.0	544.1
turning	544.1	544.6
back.	544.6	544.7
Yeah,	546.0	546.4
I'm	546.4	546.6
sure	546.6	546.9
now	546.9	547.7
get	547.7	548.1
out	548.1	548.3
of	548.3	548.4
here	548.4	548.5
before	548.5	548.7
I	548.7	549.0
change	549.0	549.1
my	549.1	549.4
mind.	549.4	549.6
Really	555.1	557.7
think	557.7	557.9
this	557.9	558.0
moving	558.0	558.3
in	558.3	558.5
with	558.5	558.6
Rachel,	558.6	558.9
was	558.9	559.1
a	559.1	559.1
good	559.1	559.4
idea.	559.4	559.5
I've	559.5	560.8
been	560.8	560.9
back	560.9	561.3

forth	561.3	561.5
that	561.5	563.6
well,	563.6	563.8
maybe	563.8	564.0
you	564.0	564.1
should	564.1	564.3
go	564.3	564.4
back,	564.4	564.5
okay?	564.5	565.4
Wait	565.4	566.8
to	566.8	566.9
move	566.9	567.1

be	569.7	569.8
back	569.8	570.3
together,	570.3	570.7
I	570.7	572.2
don't	572.2	572.3
think	572.3	572.7
so.	572.7	572.8
But	572.8	573.0
she's	573.0	573.1

Maybe	587.9	590.2

I	590.4	591.1

Mobile.	602.4	603.8
I'm	603.8	603.9

do	624.4	624.6
that.	624.6	624.8
Well,	624.8	626.1
it	626.1	627.1
would	627.1	627.2
be	627.2	627.3
easier	627.3	627.7
to	627.7	627.7
move	627.7	627.9
just	627.9	628.1
right	628.1	628.2
