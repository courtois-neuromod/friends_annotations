think	133.3	135.2
this	135.2	135.4
is	135.4	135.5
probably	135.5	135.7
why	135.7	135.9
Damone	135.9	136.3
smokes	136.3	136.7

alone,	137.2	137.6

let's	579.8	583.7
start	583.7	583.8
with	583.8	584.1
the	584.1	584.1
way	584.1	584.3
he	584.3	584.5
kept	584.5	585.0
picking	585.0	585.7
at.	585.7	586.0
We	586.0	588.4
loved	588.4	588.7
him.	588.7	588.9
I	588.9	597.2
will	597.2	597.4
never	597.4	597.6
look	597.6	598.0
at	598.0	598.1
all	598.1	598.3
of	598.3	598.5
the	598.5	598.6
same	598.6	598.8

the	608.0	608.6

Boyfriends	633.0	633.8
Nana	633.8	634.0

could	634.9	635.3
be,	635.3	635.4
you	635.4	635.6

makes	651.6	651.8
me	651.8	651.9
feel	651.9	652.2

myself.	652.8	652.9
Why?	672.5	672.8
How	675.8	676.9

the	677.0	677.1
game?	677.1	677.2
Well.	678.8	679.3
Question,	684.9	685.6

that	686.2	686.3
possible?	686.3	686.4
