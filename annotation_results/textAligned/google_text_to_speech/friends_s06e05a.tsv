Now,	406.0	406.4
we	406.4	407.2
are	407.2	407.3
all	407.3	407.4
responsible	407.4	407.7
for	407.7	408.2
our	408.2	408.4
own	408.4	408.5
babies.	408.5	409.1
See	409.1	409.3
that's	409.3	409.5
why	409.5	409.8
I	409.8	409.8
think	409.8	410.0
that	410.0	410.1
you're	410.1	410.3
wrong,	410.3	410.5
you	410.5	410.9
even	410.9	411.2
playing	411.2	411.4
these	411.4	411.5
babies	411.5	411.8
man-to-man.	411.8	412.4
We	412.4	412.6
should	412.6	412.7
really	412.7	412.8
be	412.8	413.0
playing	413.0	413.2
in	413.2	413.3
the	413.3	413.4
zone	413.4	413.8
defense.	413.8	414.4
I	416.4	417.1
just	417.1	417.3
think	417.3	417.6
of	417.6	417.7
things	417.7	418.1
will	418.1	418.2
go	418.2	418.3
a	418.3	418.3
lot	418.3	418.4
smoother	418.4	418.9
for	418.9	419.1
you	419.1	419.1
Trevor	419.1	419.4
on.	419.4	419.6
So,	419.6	419.9
you	419.9	420.2
know,	420.2	420.2
baby	420.2	420.9
you	420.9	421.0
can	421.0	421.1
be	421.1	421.2
in	421.2	421.2
charge	421.2	421.3
of	421.3	421.5
wiping.	421.5	421.8
And	422.9	423.5
remind	423.5	424.2
me	424.2	424.4
in	424.4	424.5
charge	424.5	424.9
of	424.9	424.9
diapering	424.9	425.5
and	425.5	425.8
I	425.8	425.9
can	425.9	426.1
be	426.1	426.1
in	426.1	426.2
charge	426.2	426.3
of	426.3	426.7
looking	426.7	426.8
okay	426.8	427.2
with	427.2	427.3
you.	427.3	427.5
Okay,	434.3	434.8
I'm	434.8	434.9
a	434.9	435.0
rookie.	435.0	435.2
I	435.2	435.6
should	435.6	435.8
not	435.8	435.9
be	435.9	436.0
in	436.0	436.1
the	436.1	436.2
Anza.	436.2	436.5
So	448.3	448.7
great,	448.7	449.4
this	449.4	449.6
is	449.6	449.8
exactly	449.8	450.3
how	450.3	450.5
to	450.5	451.1
place	451.1	451.8
at	451.8	451.9
the	451.9	451.9
restaurant.	451.9	452.6
Not	454.2	454.6
what	454.6	454.8
I	454.8	454.9
ordered.	454.9	455.0
Hey,	460.2	460.5
guys,	460.5	460.8
are	460.8	460.9
babies.	460.9	462.2
I'm	462.2	464.1
having	464.1	464.4
the	464.4	464.4
best	464.4	464.7
morning	464.7	465.0
that	465.0	466.2
Porsche.	466.2	466.6
I've	466.6	466.8
got	466.8	467.0
the	467.0	467.1
keys	467.1	467.3
to,	467.3	467.4
you	467.4	473.6
should	473.6	473.9
see	473.9	474.1
the	474.1	474.3
treatment.	474.3	474.7
I	474.7	474.8
get	474.8	474.9
when	474.9	475.0
I'm	475.0	475.2
with	475.2	475.4
that	475.4	475.4
car,	475.4	475.9
people	475.9	476.7
are	476.7	476.9
friendly	476.9	477.5
there.	477.5	477.8
They	477.8	478.0
want	478.0	478.2
to	478.2	478.3
talk	478.3	478.5
and	478.5	479.1
not	479.1	479.2
just	479.2	479.3
about	479.3	479.5
the	479.5	479.6
car.	479.6	480.0
One	480.0	480.3
guy	480.3	480.4
gave	480.4	480.7
me	480.7	480.7
advice	480.7	480.9
about	480.9	481.1
my	481.1	481.3
Equity	481.3	481.7
Investments.	481.7	482.2
What?	482.2	482.7
Equity	482.7	483.0
Investments,	483.0	483.6
the	483.6	483.8
ones	483.8	484.1
that	484.1	484.2
got	484.2	484.4
me	484.4	484.6
the	484.6	484.6
portion	484.6	485.1
where	485.1	485.2
you	485.2	485.3
keep	485.3	485.4
up,	485.4	485.8
So	490.6	491.0
I	491.0	491.1
figured	491.1	491.4
if	491.4	491.5
people	491.5	492.0
keep	492.0	492.2
seeing	492.2	492.5
me	492.5	492.6
just	492.6	492.9
standing	492.9	493.4
there,	493.4	493.7
they're	493.7	493.9
going	493.9	494.0
to	494.0	494.1
start	494.1	494.3
to	494.3	494.4
think	494.4	494.5
I	494.5	494.7
don't	494.7	494.9
own	494.9	495.1
it	495.1	495.3
so	495.3	495.9
I	495.9	496.3
figured	496.3	496.4
I'll	496.4	496.7
wash	496.7	497.0
it	497.0	497.2
right	497.2	497.4
carnuba	497.4	503.3
wax	503.3	504.0
and	504.0	504.3
Polishing	504.3	505.2
Compound.	505.2	505.9
You	507.2	507.6
don't	507.6	507.7
even	507.7	507.8
have	507.8	507.9
a	507.9	508.0
car.	508.0	508.3
One	508.3	509.9
time,	509.9	510.1
there	510.1	510.2
was	510.2	510.3
this	510.3	510.4
really	510.4	510.5
dirty	510.5	511.0
car	511.0	511.2
parked	511.2	511.5
in	511.5	511.5
front	511.5	511.6
of	511.6	511.7
building	511.7	512.1
so	512.1	512.3
I	512.3	512.5
washed	512.5	512.9
it.	512.9	513.0
And	516.5	517.0
six	517.0	517.2
others.	517.2	517.3
Yeah,	522.4	522.7
she	522.7	523.0
tops	523.0	523.4
out	523.4	523.5
at	523.5	523.7
1:30.	523.7	524.2
Answers	525.9	526.6
to	526.6	526.7
the	526.7	526.8
city.	526.8	527.1
I	527.1	527.3
got	527.3	527.5
off	527.5	527.7
the	527.7	527.8
160.	527.8	528.4
Going	528.4	528.5
to	528.5	528.6
take	528.6	528.7
her	528.7	528.8
up	528.8	528.9
stick,	528.9	529.2
really	529.2	529.9
see	529.9	536.5
you	536.5	536.6
later.	536.6	536.8
Okay.	539.8	540.2
That's	541.5	541.9
my	541.9	542.1
car,	542.1	542.3
really?	542.3	543.5
What	548.6	549.0
are	549.0	549.2
you	549.2	549.3
doing?	549.3	549.5
I	549.5	551.1
found	551.1	551.3
the	551.3	551.5
keys	551.5	551.8
and	551.8	551.9
then	551.9	552.0
I'm	552.0	552.3
just	552.3	552.5
pushing	552.5	552.8
on	552.8	553.1
it,	553.1	553.2
but	553.2	554.3
it's	554.3	554.4
my	554.4	554.6
car.	554.6	555.1
I	558.6	558.6
don't	558.6	559.6
come	559.6	559.8
to	559.8	559.9
the	559.9	560.1
city	560.1	560.5
much	560.5	561.0
and	561.0	561.3
I	561.3	561.5
don't	561.5	561.7
know	561.7	561.8
if	561.8	561.9
you're	561.9	562.0
crazy	562.0	562.4
or	562.4	562.8
if	562.8	563.1
this	563.1	563.2
is	563.2	563.3
some	563.3	563.5
kind	563.5	563.6
of	563.6	563.9
Street	563.9	564.5
Theater,	564.5	564.9
but	564.9	565.8
should	565.8	567.0
I	567.0	567.0
have	567.0	567.1
my	567.1	567.2
keys.	567.2	571.2
Coming	571.2	571.6
back?	571.6	571.8
Why	573.1	573.5
not?	573.5	573.8
I	573.8	574.3
live	574.3	574.4
Upstate	574.4	574.9
so	574.9	576.3
did	576.3	576.5
I?	576.5	576.7
Oh,	580.0	580.1
I	580.1	580.2
was	580.2	580.4
so	580.4	580.5
nervous	580.5	580.8
about	580.8	581.2
this,	581.2	581.5
and	581.5	582.2
I	582.2	582.3
don't	582.3	582.4
know	582.4	582.5
why	582.5	582.7
Frank	582.7	582.9
and	582.9	583.1
Alice	583.1	583.3
are	583.3	583.5
always	583.5	583.7
complaining.	583.7	584.0
This	584.0	584.3
is	584.3	584.5
so	584.5	584.6
easy	584.6	584.7
to	584.7	585.3
h,	585.3	586.4
a	586.4	586.4
lifetime.	586.4	586.9
That's	586.9	587.1
the	587.1	587.2
same.	587.2	587.5
Check	589.8	590.2
it	590.2	590.5
out.	590.5	590.6
Check	590.6	590.8
it	590.8	591.1
out.	591.1	591.3
When	591.3	591.8
the	591.8	591.9
babies	591.9	592.2
wake	592.2	592.4
up	592.4	592.6
thinking	592.6	593.0
me,	593.0	593.3
Prague.	593.3	593.7
Hey,	597.0	597.4
what	597.4	597.6
are	597.6	597.6
you	597.6	597.7
doing?	597.7	597.8
I	597.8	598.2
think	598.2	598.2
it's	598.2	598.5
a	598.5	598.6
someone's	598.6	598.9
eye	598.9	599.1
out	599.1	599.4
that	599.4	600.6
he	600.6	600.7
can	600.7	600.8
destroy	600.8	601.0
the	601.0	601.5
universe.	601.5	601.7
Hearts	606.1	606.8
and	606.8	607.0
also	607.0	607.2
look	607.2	607.4
at	607.4	607.5
his	607.5	607.7
smooth	607.7	608.0
area,	608.0	608.4
that's	608.4	608.7
just	608.7	608.9
going	608.9	609.1
to	609.1	609.1
mess	609.1	609.3
them	609.3	609.5
up.	609.5	609.6
Appropriate	611.9	612.9
toys	612.9	613.0
for	613.0	613.2
1	613.2	613.5

or	613.9	614.3
30	614.3	614.6
year	614.6	614.7
olds.	614.7	615.0
You're	615.9	616.2
not	616.2	616.4
going	616.4	616.5
to	616.5	616.5
swallow	616.5	616.9
anything.	616.9	617.2
You	617.2	617.4
guys	617.4	617.5
have	617.5	617.6
been	617.6	617.7
way	617.7	617.9
too	617.9	618.0
overprotective	618.0	618.4
when	618.4	619.0
I	619.0	619.1
was	619.1	619.3
a	619.3	619.3
kid.	619.3	619.5
My	619.5	619.6
mom	619.6	619.8
used	619.8	620.0
to,	620.0	620.0
just	620.0	620.3
throw	620.3	620.8
me	620.8	620.9
into	620.9	621.1
a	621.1	621.2
pile	621.2	621.5
of	621.5	621.5
broken	621.5	621.7
glass.	621.7	622.0
Glass,	624.3	624.9
and	624.9	625.4
whatever.	625.4	625.7
Oh,	628.7	629.1
look	629.1	629.5
at	629.5	629.7
little	629.7	629.9
Leslie	629.9	630.4
stretching	630.4	630.9
in	630.9	631.0
her	631.0	631.1
sleep.	631.1	631.6
So	631.6	631.8
it's	631.8	632.1
so	632.1	632.1
cute.	632.1	632.7
I	632.7	633.3
want	633.3	633.4
to	633.4	633.5
what	633.5	633.6
age	633.6	633.8
is	633.8	633.9
that	633.9	634.1
you	634.1	634.3
stopped	634.3	634.5
being	634.5	634.6
able	634.6	634.7
to	634.7	634.8
put	634.8	635.0
both	635.0	635.2
legs	635.2	635.4
behind	635.4	635.6
your	635.6	635.8
head.	635.8	635.9
Still	635.9	637.0
do	637.0	637.1
that.	637.1	637.4
How	639.2	639.6
are	639.6	639.8
you	639.8	640.0
still	640.0	640.1
single?	640.1	640.4
I	643.4	643.9
thought	643.9	645.6
about	645.6	645.7
it.	645.7	645.9
Maybe	645.9	646.2
you're	646.2	646.4
right,	646.4	646.5
baby	646.5	646.9
frog	646.9	647.2
is	647.2	647.3
not	647.3	647.5
a	647.5	647.6
safe	647.6	647.8
toy.	647.8	648.0
Well,	655.3	655.7
I	655.7	655.8
was	655.8	655.9
trying	655.9	655.9
to	655.9	656.1
prove	656.1	656.3
that	656.3	656.4
I	656.4	656.4
was	656.4	656.6
right,	656.6	656.9
turns	656.9	658.5
out,	658.5	658.6
I	658.6	658.7
was	658.7	658.8
wrong	658.8	659.0
and	659.0	659.4
now	659.4	660.6
it's	660.6	660.7
not	660.7	660.9
my	660.9	661.2
throat.	661.2	661.7
