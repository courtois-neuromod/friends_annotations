In	0.1	0.3
the	0.3	0.4
dream	0.4	0.9
I	0.9	1.6
got	1.6	1.8
to	1.8	2.0
go	2.0	2.1
pour	2.1	2.3
coffee	2.3	2.5

I	3.2	3.2
don't	3.2	3.4
know,	3.4	3.5
don't	3.5	4.7
wait	4.7	4.9
up.	4.9	5.2
Oh,	7.7	8.0
by	8.0	8.8
the	8.8	8.8
way,	8.8	9.0
tomorrow,	9.0	10.2
we're	10.2	10.7
auditioning	10.7	10.9
for	10.9	11.2
Broadway	11.2	11.4
show.	11.4	12.0
There's	14.8	16.0
an	16.0	16.0
open	16.0	16.3
call	16.3	16.5
for	16.5	16.6
cats.	16.6	17.1
I'm	17.1	18.0
thinking	18.0	18.3
we	18.3	18.4
go	18.4	18.5
down	18.5	19.0
there,	19.0	19.2
sing	19.2	20.1
memories,	20.1	20.3
and	20.3	21.0
make	21.0	21.1
complete	21.1	21.7
fools	21.7	21.8
of	21.8	22.1
ourselves.	22.1	22.2
What	22.2	23.2
do	23.2	23.3
you	23.3	23.4
say?	23.4	23.5
Remember	23.5	27.3
who	27.3	27.6
you're	27.6	27.7
dealing	27.7	27.8
with	27.8	28.2
here	28.2	28.3
like	28.3	30.6
you?	30.6	30.9
What	37.3	37.7
will	37.7	38.3
your	38.3	38.4
Pennsylvania	38.4	38.7
Dutch?	38.7	39.2
Right.	39.2	39.5
Right.	39.5	40.7
So	40.7	41.9
I	41.9	42.0
bought	42.0	42.2
a	42.2	42.3
blow	42.3	42.5
dryer.	42.5	42.9
To	47.4	47.7
be	47.7	47.8
just	47.8	47.9
like	47.9	48.2
you	48.2	48.4
and	48.4	48.7
then	48.7	49.0
one	49.0	49.2
day	49.2	49.4
I	49.4	50.0
saw	50.0	50.3
a	50.3	50.4
movie	50.4	50.6
that	50.6	50.8
changed	50.8	51.7
my	51.7	51.8
life.	51.8	51.9
Do	51.9	53.3
you	53.3	53.3
ever	53.3	53.5
see	53.5	53.6
Dead	53.6	53.9
Poets	53.9	54.2
Society,	54.2	54.3
boring?	54.3	60.4
Begin	62.4	63.0
where	63.0	63.2
the	63.2	63.3
kid	63.3	63.6
kills	63.6	63.9
himself	63.9	64.0
because	64.0	64.3
he	64.3	64.7
can't	64.7	65.1
be	65.1	65.2
in	65.2	65.4
the	65.4	65.6
play.	65.6	65.9
If	68.1	68.6
I	68.6	68.7
could	68.7	69.3
wait	69.3	70.1
a	70.1	70.2
year,	70.2	70.2
leave	70.2	70.9
home	70.9	71.3
do	71.3	71.7
some	71.7	71.9
Community	71.9	72.2
Theater.	72.2	72.9
I	75.6	76.6
thought	76.6	77.0
now	77.0	77.4
that's	77.4	77.8
two	77.8	78.1
hours	78.1	78.5
of	78.5	78.7
my	78.7	78.8
life	78.8	79.1
that	79.1	79.9
I'm	79.9	80.2
never	80.2	80.6
getting	80.6	81.0
back	81.0	81.1
and	81.1	82.3
that	82.3	82.6
thought	82.6	82.8
scared	82.8	83.3
me	83.3	83.5
more	83.5	83.6
than	83.6	83.7
all	83.7	83.9
the	83.9	84.0
other	84.0	84.2
crap	84.2	84.5
I	84.5	84.7
was	84.7	84.8
afraid	84.8	85.0
to	85.0	85.2
do	85.2	85.4
then	85.4	87.8
I	87.8	87.9
would	87.9	88.0
definitely	88.0	88.1
not	88.1	88.5
recommend	88.5	89.0
mrs.	89.0	89.2
Doubtfire.	89.2	89.4
God.	95.2	98.7
We	99.6	101.0
didn't	101.0	101.1
get	101.1	101.3
into	101.3	101.4
Scranton.	101.4	102.1
That	105.0	105.4
was	105.4	105.6
like,	105.6	105.7
our	105.7	105.9
safety	105.9	106.6
Zoo.	106.6	106.9
Protect	108.7	109.3
like	109.3	109.4
dogs.	109.4	110.3
I	114.2	115.9
don't	115.9	116.0
know	116.0	116.1
who	116.1	116.3
this	116.3	116.4
is	116.4	116.6
harder	116.6	117.0
on	117.0	117.1
me	117.1	117.5
or	117.5	117.8
him?	117.8	118.3
Mr.	120.0	120.4

Boy.	125.2	130.6
Say,	131.7	132.2
how	132.2	132.4
could	132.4	132.6
nobody	132.6	133.0
want	133.0	133.4

kidding.	147.2	147.7
Apparently,	147.7	150.0
he	150.0	150.2
was	150.2	150.4
just	150.4	150.6
Russian	150.6	151.2

that	151.6	152.6
all	152.6	152.8
these	152.8	153.0
people.	153.0	153.1
You	155.3	155.7
think	155.7	155.9
you	155.9	156.2

stage	173.4	174.0
name	174.0	174.3
for	174.3	174.4
me	174.4	174.6

Why.	228.0	228.6
Why	228.6	228.6
why?	228.6	229.3
Why	229.3	229.4
would	229.4	230.2
he	230.2	230.2
say	230.2	231.3
if	231.3	232.3
he's	232.3	232.5
