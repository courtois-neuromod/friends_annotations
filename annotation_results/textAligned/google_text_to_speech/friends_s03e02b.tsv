You	245.1	245.4
got	245.4	245.6
a	245.6	245.6
phone	245.6	245.7
in	245.7	245.9

says	260.3	260.5
Black	260.5	261.0
Tie	261.0	261.2
optional,	261.2	261.4
but	261.4	262.1
this	262.1	263.8
may	263.8	264.0
be	264.0	264.1

a	299.4	299.4
very	299.4	299.5
Museum	299.5	300.4
benefit,	300.4	301.0
he	301.0	301.1
kind	301.1	301.3
of	301.3	301.4
mood.	301.4	301.7
Okay,	301.7	303.4

I'm	304.3	304.5
sorry,	304.5	304.7
I'm	304.7	305.3
sorry,	305.3	305.5
I	305.5	305.7
yelled,	305.7	305.8
I	305.8	306.3
don't	306.3	306.6
know,	306.6	306.9
but	306.9	307.1
you	307.1	308.3
mad,	308.3	308.8

have	314.2	314.8
to	314.8	315.8
go	315.8	316.0
by.	316.0	316.6
So	316.6	317.2
is	317.2	317.7
it	317.7	317.8
going	317.8	317.9
to	317.9	318.0

and	325.6	326.3
humiliating,	326.3	327.0
