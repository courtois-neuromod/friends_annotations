guy	161.8	162.1
who	162.1	162.4
controls	162.4	162.9
it.	162.9	163.0
I	163.0	163.3
didn't	163.3	163.5
know	163.5	163.5
what	163.5	163.6
you	163.6	163.7

And	165.8	168.7
got	168.7	169.1
kind	169.1	170.6
of	170.6	170.8
a	170.8	170.9
problem	170.9	171.2
is	171.2	171.4
not	171.4	180.9
a	180.9	181.0
bad	181.0	181.2
idea,	181.2	181.3
but	181.3	183.3
if	183.3	183.4
I	183.4	183.4
get	183.4	183.6

People	210.9	211.5
who	211.5	211.7
Marsha	211.7	214.6

Chester.	214.9	215.6
Then	218.5	218.9
you	218.9	218.9
know	218.9	219.0
what?	219.0	219.1
I	219.1	219.3
will	219.3	219.5
just	219.5	219.7
write	219.7	219.9
about	219.9	220.4
Phyllis	220.4	221.2
Phyllis	221.2	222.9
is	222.9	223.6
sitting	223.6	224.0
in	224.0	224.1
the	224.1	224.1
chair,	224.1	224.2
I	224.2	225.1
see	225.1	225.3
what	225.3	225.5
you're	225.5	225.6
doing,	225.6	225.8
what	225.8	227.5
I'm	227.5	227.6
doing.	227.6	227.7
I	227.7	230.6
have	230.6	230.9
tasted	230.9	231.4
my	231.4	231.6
own	231.6	231.8
medicine	231.8	232.0
and	232.0	232.5
it	232.5	232.7
is	232.7	232.9
bitter.	232.9	233.4
Morning.	240.2	241.2
How's	241.2	242.4
my	242.4	242.5
favorite?	242.5	242.9
Genius	242.9	243.4

a	243.5	243.6
little	243.6	243.9
robot	243.9	244.2
buddy?	244.2	244.6
I	244.6	244.7
don't	244.7	244.8
touch	244.8	245.1
that.	245.1	252.5
I	252.5	252.6
might	252.6	252.8
get	252.8	252.9
fired	252.9	253.3
because	253.3	253.8
even	253.8	254.1
have	254.1	254.2
actors	254.2	254.6
coming	254.6	254.9
in	254.9	255.0
to	255.0	255.4
read	255.4	255.6
for	255.6	255.8
my	255.8	255.9
part.	255.9	256.4
Come	256.4	257.0
on,	257.0	257.4
man.	257.4	257.6
You	257.6	257.7
got	257.7	258.0
to	258.0	258.1
give	258.1	258.2
me	258.2	258.3
a	258.3	258.4
second	258.4	258.7
chance.	258.7	258.8
Believer.	267.9	270.5
Hey,	273.4	273.8
how	273.8	274.5
you	274.5	274.6
doing?	274.6	275.2
So	280.9	281.3
it	281.3	281.5
seemed	281.5	282.1
that	282.1	282.2
my	282.2	282.6
prom	282.6	283.2
date	283.2	283.4
and	283.4	283.7
stood	283.7	284.0
me	284.0	284.2
up.	284.2	284.4
So	284.4	284.8
Ross	284.8	285.3
selflessly	285.3	286.5
offered	286.5	288.5
to	288.5	288.6
take	288.6	288.7
me	288.7	289.0
and	289.0	293.7
decided	293.7	293.9
to	293.9	294.2
jump	294.2	294.5
at	294.5	294.7
the	294.7	294.7
chance	294.7	294.8
to	294.8	295.2
take	295.2	295.4
a	295.4	295.5
young	295.5	295.6
girl	295.6	295.9
to	295.9	296.1
her	296.1	296.2
High	296.2	296.3
School	296.3	296.5
prom.	296.5	296.9
I	299.9	300.3
definitely	300.3	301.3
did	301.3	301.5
not	301.5	301.5
see	301.5	301.7
that	301.7	301.8
one.	301.8	302.0
Backfire.	302.0	302.6
The	304.4	304.7
bathroom,	304.7	305.1
take	305.1	306.0
your	306.0	306.1
time.	306.1	306.6
Just	310.1	310.6
so,	310.6	310.7
you	310.7	310.8
know,	310.8	310.8
I	310.8	311.1
was	311.1	311.2
a	311.2	311.3
freshman	311.3	311.5
and	311.5	311.8
she	311.8	311.9
was	311.9	312.0
a	312.0	312.1
senior	312.1	312.5
so	312.5	312.6
it	312.6	312.7
wasn't	312.7	313.0
as	313.0	313.3
bad	313.3	313.5
as	313.5	313.8
running.	313.8	314.2
Look,	314.2	314.7
I	314.7	315.3
know	315.3	315.6
I've	315.6	315.8
been	315.8	316.0

a	316.3	316.4
lot	316.4	316.4
of	316.4	316.6
Jabs	316.6	317.1
and	317.1	317.2
it's	318.4	318.9
partly	318.9	319.2
because	319.2	319.3
I'm	319.3	319.6
very	319.6	319.8
protective	319.8	320.0
of	320.0	321.0
Lizzie	321.0	321.4
and	321.4	321.6
partly	321.6	322.7
because	322.7	322.8
well,	322.8	323.7
Please	324.9	325.3
keep	325.3	325.5

teach	571.1	571.3
me	571.3	571.4
how	571.4	571.5

to	572.0	572.1
women	572.1	572.4
like	572.4	572.7
you	572.7	573.0
do,	573.0	573.2
well	573.2	574.1
Wayne	574.1	574.4
start	574.4	575.7
really	575.7	575.9
something	575.9	576.2
you	576.2	576.3
could	576.3	576.5
teach,	576.5	576.8
you	576.8	576.9
know,	576.9	577.0
it's	577.0	577.2
pretty	577.2	577.3
much	577.3	577.5
something	577.5	577.9
you're	577.9	578.1
born	578.1	578.2
with.	578.2	578.5
Really.	582.3	583.3
I	594.7	595.0
mean,	595.0	595.2
if	595.2	595.3
you	595.3	595.6
think	595.6	595.8
about	595.8	596.0
it,	596.0	596.4
I	596.4	596.5
mean	596.5	596.6
Ross	596.6	596.9
did	596.9	597.3
learn	597.3	597.6
something	597.6	598.1
from	598.1	598.4
each	598.4	598.9
marriage	598.9	599.6
even	599.6	601.3
shorter	601.3	601.8
now.	601.8	603.4
Wait	603.4	603.6
a	603.6	603.7
minute	603.7	603.8
that's	603.8	604.0
not	604.0	604.4
fair	604.4	604.7
that	604.7	606.8
he	606.8	606.9
was	606.9	607.0
married	607.0	607.1
to	607.1	607.3
didn't	607.3	608.7
tell	608.7	609.0
me	609.0	609.2
I	609.2	614.7
have	614.7	614.8
to	614.8	614.9
pee	614.9	615.1
again.	615.1	615.2
Village	620.9	621.4
of	621.4	621.5
fun.	621.5	621.9
Can	625.5	625.9
you	625.9	626.0
kill	626.0	626.2
any	626.2	626.3
of	626.3	626.3
these	626.3	626.4
wives?	626.4	626.9
I	629.1	629.4
only	629.4	629.7
had	629.7	630.0
enough	630.0	630.4
of	630.4	630.6
this,	630.6	630.8
why	630.8	631.4
I	631.4	631.8
care	631.8	632.3
a	632.3	632.3
great	632.3	632.4
deal	632.4	632.7
about	632.7	633.3
your	633.3	633.6
daughter	633.6	634.0
and	634.0	634.2
I	634.2	634.3
have	634.3	634.5
treated	634.5	634.8
her	634.8	634.9
with	634.9	635.1
nothing	635.1	635.5
but	635.5	635.8
respect.	635.8	636.5
So	636.5	636.9
if	636.9	637.1
you	637.1	637.2
got	637.2	637.6
a	637.6	637.7
problem	637.7	637.7
with	637.7	638.2
me,	638.2	638.3
frankly,	638.3	639.0
I'm	639.0	639.3
yelling	639.3	639.6
at	639.6	639.8
me.	639.8	639.9
If	639.9	644.8
you	644.8	644.9
don't	644.9	645.0
like	645.0	645.3
rice,	645.3	645.6
that's	645.6	646.2
fine.	646.2	646.6
It	646.6	647.6
doesn't	647.6	647.7
matter	647.7	648.0
to	648.0	648.1
me.	648.1	648.2
I'm	648.2	649.1
going	649.1	649.2
to	649.2	649.2
go	649.2	649.4
out	649.4	649.5
with	649.5	649.6
him	649.6	649.7
anyway.	649.7	650.1
Really.	651.1	651.7
Well,	652.7	653.2
if	653.2	653.3
it	653.3	653.7
doesn't	653.7	653.8
matter	653.8	654.3
to	654.3	654.4
her	654.4	654.7
it	654.7	655.5
doesn't	655.5	655.8
matter	655.8	656.2
to	656.2	656.2
me,	656.2	656.3
still	656.3	657.1
not	657.1	657.5
going.	657.5	657.7
I	662.4	662.8
say.	662.8	663.0
So	667.1	667.6
they	667.6	667.7
make	667.7	667.9
me	667.9	668.1
like	668.1	668.3
you	668.3	668.4
any	668.4	668.6
better.	668.6	668.7
That's	668.7	669.2
okay.	669.2	669.5
I'm	669.5	669.7
not	669.7	669.8
so	669.8	670.0
crazy	670.0	670.1
about	670.1	670.3
myself	670.3	670.9
right	670.9	671.0
now,	671.0	671.1
either,	671.1	671.4
and	671.4	672.9
we	672.9	673.0
agree.	673.0	673.3
I	682.9	683.2
just	683.2	683.5
thought	683.5	683.6
of	683.6	683.8
another	683.8	683.8
story.	683.8	684.3
Brasas	684.4	685.7
right	685.7	687.9
now.	687.9	688.1
Well,	694.8	695.3
it	695.3	695.5
turns	695.5	695.6
out	695.6	695.9
you	695.9	696.1
were	696.1	696.1
right	696.1	696.3
cheese.	696.3	696.9
