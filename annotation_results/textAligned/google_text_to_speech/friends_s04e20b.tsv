just	54.2	56.6
one	56.6	61.0

where	61.5	61.9
I	61.9	62.0
said	62.0	62.2
that	62.2	62.3
I	62.3	62.4
think	62.4	62.5
we	62.5	62.7
would	62.7	63.1
need	63.1	63.2
to	63.2	63.3
work	63.3	63.6
on	63.6	63.7
but	63.7	64.5
I	64.5	64.6
would	64.6	64.8
think	64.8	64.8
it	64.8	65.7
was	65.7	65.7
that	65.7	65.9
we're	65.9	66.0
just	66.0	66.0

I'm	70.9	71.2
not	71.2	71.6
too	71.6	71.8
sure.	71.8	71.9
I	71.9	72.2
agree	72.2	72.3
with	72.3	72.6

we	76.6	76.9
can	76.9	77.0
we	77.0	77.2
have	77.2	77.3
a	77.3	77.4
fun.	77.4	77.8

I'm	442.7	443.0
totally	443.0	443.6
okay	443.6	443.8
with	443.8	444.2
Ross	444.2	444.5
getting	444.5	444.8
married,	444.8	445.2
but	445.2	446.3
as	446.3	446.4
it	446.4	446.6
turns	446.6	446.9
out,	446.9	446.9
I	446.9	448.3

out	455.9	456.1
why	456.1	456.3
any	456.3	457.6
luck.	457.6	457.9
I	464.6	464.9
guess	464.9	465.0
I	465.0	465.1
just	465.1	465.3
figured	465.3	465.4
it's	465.4	465.9
somewhere	465.9	466.3
down	466.3	467.1
the	467.1	467.3
road,	467.3	467.3
we	467.3	468.3
would	468.3	468.5
be	468.5	468.6
on	468.6	468.8
again.	468.8	469.0
Again.	470.2	470.8
