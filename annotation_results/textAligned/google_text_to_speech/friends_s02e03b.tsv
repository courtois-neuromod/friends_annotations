I've	551.6	552.0
been	552.0	552.0
holding	552.0	552.2

out	552.8	552.9
in	552.9	553.1
the	553.1	553.1
past	553.1	553.6
because	553.6	553.7
she	553.7	554.0
has	554.0	554.3
a	554.3	554.4
unusually	556.4	557.5
large	557.5	557.9
head.	557.9	558.2
But	559.4	559.9
I'm	559.9	560.1
not	560.1	560.3
going	560.3	560.4
to	560.4	560.5
let	560.5	560.6

stuff.	560.7	561.0
Hang	561.0	561.2
up	561.2	561.4
anymore.	561.4	561.7
Look	561.7	563.7
at	563.7	563.8
me.	563.8	564.0
I'm	564.0	564.4
growing.	564.4	564.9
I'll	570.0	570.4
take	570.4	570.5
you	570.5	571.7
want	571.7	571.9

nice	574.9	575.1
things	575.1	575.1
about	575.1	575.5
him.	575.5	575.8
Think	575.8	576.1
somebody	576.1	576.4
should	576.4	576.5
have.	576.5	576.6
It	576.6	576.9
is	576.9	578.3
so	578.3	578.5
weird.	578.5	578.8
When	580.1	580.5
his	580.5	580.6
whole	580.6	581.0
life	581.0	581.3
was	581.3	581.5
in	581.5	581.6
this	581.6	581.7

gone.	582.9	583.1
No,	584.6	585.0
I	585.0	585.1
think	585.1	585.2
it	585.2	585.3
would	585.3	585.4
be	585.4	585.5
nice	585.5	585.6
if	585.6	585.8
we	585.8	585.9
just	585.9	586.1

I	655.5	655.9
mean,	655.9	656.1
how	656.1	656.2

the	668.3	668.4
lighting.	668.4	668.8
My	669.7	670.1
head	670.1	670.2
