Messi's.	6.2	6.8
Come	9.3	9.5
on	9.5	9.9
you	9.9	10.1
guys.	10.1	10.3
I	10.3	10.6

we	10.6	12.8
know	12.8	13.0
we	13.0	13.4
know,	13.4	13.6
we	13.6	13.9
know	13.9	14.2
What?	17.9	18.3
That	21.3	21.6
wasn't	21.6	21.9
you?	21.9	22.0
Rossi,	24.9	27.2
you	27.2	27.4
got	27.4	27.6
to	27.6	27.7
stop	27.7	27.9
torturing	27.9	28.4
yourself.	28.4	29.6
You	29.6	29.7
just	29.7	29.9
find	29.9	30.2
another	30.2	30.3
apartment	30.3	30.6
at	30.6	32.3
like	32.3	32.4
1000	32.4	33.3
Apartments	33.3	34.1
this	34.1	34.2
month,	34.2	34.7
and	34.7	34.9
none	34.9	35.1
of	35.1	35.2
them	35.2	35.3
even	35.3	35.4
compares	35.4	36.2
to	36.2	36.4
that	36.4	36.6
one	36.6	36.9
except	36.9	38.0
for	38.0	38.2
one.	38.2	38.6
But	38.6	38.8
I	38.8	38.8
would	38.8	39.0
have	39.0	39.1
had	39.1	39.1
the	39.1	39.3
shirt	39.3	39.5
with	39.5	39.7
Armenian	39.7	40.2
family.	40.2	40.7
Grandma	40.7	42.6
really	42.6	42.8
like	42.8	43.1
me.	43.1	43.4
One,	45.4	45.8
ugly	45.8	46.0
naked	46.0	46.5
Apartments,	46.5	47.5
you	47.5	49.3
know	49.3	49.4
what	49.4	49.5
you	49.5	49.6
should	49.6	49.6
do,	49.6	50.0
you	50.0	50.6
should	50.6	50.8
find	50.8	51.3
out	51.3	51.5
what	51.5	51.6
his	51.6	51.7
hobbies	51.7	52.2
are	52.2	52.5
and	52.5	52.7
then	52.7	52.9
use	52.9	53.2
that	53.2	53.4
to	53.4	53.6
bond	53.6	54.1
with	54.1	54.3
him.	54.3	54.4
Like	54.4	55.5
if	55.5	55.6
I	55.6	55.7
wanted	55.7	56.0
something	56.0	56.2
from	56.2	56.3
Joey,	56.3	57.1
I	57.1	57.5
would	57.5	57.6
strike	57.6	58.1
up	58.1	58.2
a	58.2	58.3
conversation	58.3	58.3
about	58.3	59.1
sandwiches	59.1	61.0
or	61.0	63.5
wear	63.5	64.2
my	64.2	64.3
underwear.	64.3	64.6
I'm	66.1	66.5
listening.	66.5	66.9
That	69.8	70.2
is	70.2	71.5
a	71.5	71.7
great	71.7	72.0
idea	72.0	72.4
and	72.4	73.8
I	73.8	74.3
know,	74.3	74.5
ugly	74.5	75.2
naked	75.2	75.5
guy,	75.5	75.7
because	75.7	76.2
we've	76.2	76.3
been	76.3	76.5
watching	76.5	76.8
him	76.8	76.9
for	76.9	77.1
like	77.1	77.2
5	77.2	77.4
years,	77.4	77.8
so	77.8	78.3
that	78.3	78.4
gives	78.4	78.9
me	78.9	79.2
back	79.2	79.8
my	79.8	80.1
Edge.	80.1	80.9
Let's	80.9	82.4
see.	82.4	82.6
Now,	82.6	82.8
he	82.8	83.0
had	83.0	83.3
the	83.3	83.5
trampoline.	83.5	84.4
He	84.4	85.1
broke	85.1	85.4
that	85.4	85.6
will	85.6	86.0
hear	86.0	86.2
gravity	86.2	86.7
boots.	86.7	87.0
So	89.8	90.3
he	90.3	90.6
likes	90.6	90.9
to	90.9	90.9
Break	90.9	91.4
Stuff.	91.4	91.8
Do.	95.2	95.5
Okay,	95.5	95.8
I've	95.8	95.9
got	95.9	96.1

go	96.1	96.2
pick	96.2	96.4
up,	96.4	96.5
man.	96.5	96.7
But	96.7	96.8
I	96.8	97.1
will	97.1	97.4
figure	97.4	97.7
something	97.7	98.2
out.	98.2	98.3
I	99.6	99.8
used	99.8	100.4
to	100.4	100.5
have	100.5	100.7
a	100.7	100.8
cat.	100.8	101.1
I	101.1	101.7
wouldn't	101.7	102.0
bring	102.0	102.2
that	102.2	102.3
up	102.3	102.5
would	102.5	102.7
probably	102.7	103.1
just	103.1	103.3
send	103.3	103.5
them	103.5	103.6
out	103.6	103.7
or	103.7	104.6
never	104.6	105.2
saw	105.2	105.4
