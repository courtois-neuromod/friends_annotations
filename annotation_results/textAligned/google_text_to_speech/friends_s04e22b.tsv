be	2.0	2.1
too	2.1	2.2
hard	2.2	2.5
and	2.5	2.7
given	2.7	3.1
the	3.1	3.4
history	3.4	3.8
and	3.8	5.0
all	5.0	5.1
that	5.1	5.5
reminds	5.5	6.8
me	6.8	6.9
of	6.9	7.2
the	7.2	7.4
time	7.4	7.5
when	7.5	7.8
I	7.8	7.9
was	7.9	7.9
living	7.9	9.0

this	17.8	17.9
like	17.9	18.1
that?	18.1	18.3
It's	18.3	20.3
not	20.3	20.4
really	20.4	21.5
that	21.5	24.0
was	24.0	24.2
an	24.2	24.3
actual	24.3	24.6
problem	24.6	25.3
and	25.3	26.1
yours	26.1	26.9

an	30.6	30.8
adapter.	30.8	31.1
I'm	33.4	37.6

I	38.5	38.7
just	38.7	39.0
saw	39.0	39.1
it.	39.1	39.4
I	44.0	44.3
don't	44.3	44.4
know	44.4	44.5

that	46.7	46.9
they	46.9	47.2
don't	47.2	47.3
care.	47.3	47.7
I	53.2	53.7

Thank	64.3	65.3

What	66.4	66.7
a	66.7	66.7
great	66.7	67.0
party	67.0	67.7
and	67.7	67.9
the	67.9	68.1
guys	68.1	68.3
from	68.3	68.4
work	68.4	68.6
had	68.6	68.8
a	68.8	68.9
blast.	68.9	69.5
You	69.5	69.8
know,	69.8	69.9
one	69.9	70.1
of	70.1	70.2
them	70.2	70.2
had	70.2	70.5
never	70.5	70.8
been	70.8	71.0
to	71.0	71.2
a	71.2	71.3
bachelor	71.3	71.8
party	71.8	71.9
before	71.9	72.4
and	72.4	73.2
another	73.2	74.0
one	74.0	74.3
I	74.3	74.4

a	75.2	75.4
party	75.4	75.9
before.	75.9	76.3
So,	78.6	79.1
I	79.1	79.3
hate	79.3	79.5
that	79.5	79.8
now	79.8	80.0
that	80.0	80.2
wedding	80.2	80.6
ring,	80.6	80.9
huh?	80.9	81.1
I	82.9	84.2

at	86.1	86.6
my	86.6	86.7
pick	86.7	87.0
my	87.0	87.1
little	87.1	87.2
babies	87.2	87.7
up	87.7	87.8
for	87.8	88.0
myself.	88.0	88.2
I	88.2	89.0
might	89.0	89.2
want	89.2	89.5
to	89.5	89.5
get	89.5	89.7
one	89.7	90.0
of	90.0	90.0
those	90.0	90.2
that	90.2	92.4
ring	92.4	92.7
when	92.7	94.0
my	94.0	94.0
grandmother	94.0	94.6
first	94.6	95.0
came	95.0	95.3
to	95.3	95.4
this	95.4	95.5
country	95.5	95.8
that	95.8	96.4
ring	96.4	96.8
and	96.8	96.9
the	96.9	97.0
clothes	97.0	97.3
on	97.3	97.5
her	97.5	97.6
back,	97.6	97.7
where	97.7	98.3
all	98.3	98.6
she	98.6	98.8
had	98.8	99.1
with	99.1	99.2
her,	99.2	99.3
She	100.6	103.0
might	103.0	103.2
say	103.2	103.5
that	103.5	103.7
the	103.7	104.0
ring	104.0	104.3
is	104.3	104.5
irreplaceable.	104.5	105.6
Play.	108.6	108.8
It's	108.8	109.0
been	109.0	109.1
in	109.1	109.2
my	109.2	109.3
family	109.3	109.4
for	109.4	109.7
generations	109.7	109.9
and	109.9	111.3
every	111.3	111.7
bride	111.7	112.2
who's	112.2	112.4
worn,	112.4	112.7
it	112.7	112.9
has	112.9	113.2
lived	113.2	113.5
a	113.5	113.5
long	113.5	113.7
and	113.7	114.0
happy	114.0	114.4
life.	114.4	114.7
So	114.7	115.5
you	115.5	115.6
might	115.6	115.7
say	115.7	116.0
it's	116.0	116.1
a	116.1	116.3
magic	116.3	117.6
ring.	117.6	118.0
Strippers.	120.9	124.0
But	126.3	127.8
what	127.8	130.6
did	130.6	130.7
you	130.7	130.8
just	130.8	131.1
think?	131.1	131.9
I	131.9	132.1
heard	132.1	132.4
what	132.4	132.5
he	132.5	132.6
said.	132.6	132.6
I	132.6	133.0
believe	133.0	133.3
it	133.3	133.4
was.	133.4	133.5
My	139.5	140.5
ring,	140.5	140.8
my,	140.8	141.1
my	141.1	141.5
wedding	141.5	142.0
with	142.0	142.2
the,	142.2	142.3
the	142.3	142.7
stripper	142.7	143.5
stole	143.5	144.8
my	144.8	145.2
wedding	145.2	145.7
ring.	145.7	146.1
How	147.2	147.6
could	147.6	147.8
this	147.8	147.9
happen?	147.9	148.3
I	148.3	148.9
think	148.9	149.1
it	149.1	149.3
all	149.3	149.4
started	149.4	149.4
when	149.4	149.8
you	149.8	149.9
said,	149.9	150.0
hey	150.0	150.2

What?	234.9	235.2
Only	235.2	235.6
come	235.6	235.8
up	235.8	235.9
here.	235.9	236.6
I	236.6	236.7
thought	236.7	236.9
I	236.9	237.0
saw	237.0	237.2
a	237.2	237.3
couple	237.3	237.6
minutes	237.6	237.9
ago	237.9	238.2
and	238.2	238.5
now	238.5	238.9
I	238.9	239.1
know	239.1	239.3
that	239.3	239.3
definitely	239.3	240.0
was	240.0	240.2
one	240.2	240.3
of	240.3	240.7
the	240.7	243.9
guys	243.9	244.3
moved	244.3	244.5
out.	244.5	244.8
It's	252.7	253.1
alright,	253.1	253.3
it's	253.3	253.5
probably	253.5	253.8
fall	253.8	254.1
flavors.	254.1	254.7
They	254.7	254.8
said	254.8	255.1
that,	255.1	255.2
that	255.2	255.3
could	255.3	255.5
happen	255.5	255.8
near	255.8	256.0
the	256.0	256.2
end	256.2	256.5
so	256.5	256.7
just	256.7	256.8
come	256.8	257.4
and	257.4	257.5
get	257.5	257.6

Okay,	270.9	271.7
this	271.7	272.1
is	272.1	272.3
great	272.3	272.5

when	275.3	275.7
she	275.7	275.9
comes	275.9	276.0
in,	276.0	276.2
hopefully	276.2	276.8
she	276.8	277.0
won't	277.0	277.2
recognize	277.2	277.7
it	277.7	277.8
because	277.8	277.9
why	277.9	279.0
would	279.0	279.1
she	279.1	279.3
okay?	279.3	281.4
And	281.4	281.4
