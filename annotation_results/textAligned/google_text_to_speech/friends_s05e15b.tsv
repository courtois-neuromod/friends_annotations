you,	460.1	460.2
I	460.2	461.0
thought	461.0	462.7
no	462.7	463.2
abrasive	463.2	463.7
drugs.	463.7	464.1
Mind-numbing,	465.8	468.8
we	468.8	469.1
stupid	469.1	470.0
and	470.0	472.0
okay.	472.0	472.4
I	478.2	479.4
think	479.4	479.8
you	479.8	479.9
all	479.9	480.1
know	480.1	480.1
what	480.1	480.3
I	480.3	480.5
mean.	480.5	480.7
Obviously,	488.2	488.8
I	488.8	488.9
didn't	488.9	489.1
think	489.1	489.2
they	489.2	489.4
were	489.4	489.5
going	489.5	489.5
to	489.5	489.7
start	489.7	489.9
throwing	489.9	490.2
things.	490.2	490.5
If	493.0	493.3
I	493.3	493.3
kept	493.3	493.7
insulting	493.7	494.0
them,	494.0	494.6
you	494.6	494.7
would	494.7	494.9
jump	494.9	495.2
in	495.2	495.4
and	495.4	495.5
defend	495.5	495.7
everyone.	495.7	496.4
And	496.4	496.6
then	496.6	496.8
you	496.8	497.0
could	497.0	497.2
look	497.2	497.3
like	497.3	497.5
the	497.5	497.6
euro,	497.6	497.9
I	501.0	501.0
did	501.0	501.6
not	501.6	501.8
get	501.8	502.0
that.	502.0	502.3
Where's	507.3	507.7

thinking	517.2	517.5
about	517.5	518.1
us.	518.1	518.5
You	518.5	518.7
have	518.7	518.8
a	518.8	518.8

and	521.7	522.2
I	522.2	522.4
well,	522.4	523.7
I	523.7	523.7
guess	523.7	523.9
there's	523.9	524.0
only	524.0	524.0
one	524.0	524.2
way	524.2	524.5

a	571.7	571.8
tune-up	571.8	572.0
behind	572.0	572.4
