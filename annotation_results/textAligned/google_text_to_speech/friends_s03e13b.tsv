be	321.6	321.7
here	321.7	321.9
any	321.9	322.1
second.	322.1	322.5
So	322.5	322.7

if	323.9	324.0
you	324.0	324.0
just	324.0	324.1
tell	324.1	324.4

please	324.7	325.5
we	331.7	332.4
can't	332.4	332.7
tell	332.7	332.8
him,	332.8	333.1
you	333.1	333.2
can't	333.2	333.4
go	333.4	333.5
up	333.5	333.6
to	333.6	333.7
a	333.7	333.8
guy,	333.8	334.0
you	334.0	334.1
barely	334.1	334.2
know	334.2	334.5
and	334.5	334.9
talk	334.9	335.0
about	335.0	335.2
his	335.2	335.5
Stuff	337.2	337.8
is	337.8	339.4
right?	339.4	339.7
Even	339.7	340.2
if	340.2	340.3
it's	340.3	340.4
to	340.4	340.7
say	340.7	340.8
something	340.8	341.2
complimentary.	341.2	341.5
Why	344.4	346.7
don't	346.7	346.8
you	346.8	346.9
just	346.9	347.1
tell	347.1	347.4
him	347.4	347.6
you're	347.6	347.8
going	347.8	348.0

I	357.9	358.3
don't	358.3	358.5
know.	358.5	358.9
I	358.9	359.1
think	359.1	359.3
this	359.3	359.5
is	359.5	359.9
an	359.9	360.1
unsolvable	360.1	360.7

this	569.2	569.3
has	569.3	569.4
been	569.4	569.6
the	569.6	569.7
most	569.7	569.8
amazing	569.8	570.5
week.	570.5	571.3
Would	573.7	574.1
it	574.1	574.1
be	574.1	574.3
so	574.3	574.4
terrible?	574.4	574.5
Even	576.3	576.8
if	576.8	576.9
we	576.9	577.0
are	577.0	577.0
friends	577.0	577.5
who	577.5	577.6
live	577.6	579.0
together.	579.0	579.1
Or	581.5	581.9
maybe	581.9	583.2
someday	583.2	583.6
friends,	583.6	584.2
who,	584.2	584.4
who	584.4	584.5
stood	584.5	586.0
up	586.0	586.1
in	586.1	586.2
front	586.2	586.4
of	586.4	586.5
their	586.5	586.6
other	586.6	586.7
friends	586.7	587.4
and	587.4	587.5
allowed	587.5	588.7
to	588.7	588.8
be	588.8	588.9
friends	588.9	589.4
forever.	589.4	589.5
you	597.0	597.4
know,	597.4	597.5
we're	597.5	597.6
back	597.6	597.7
where	597.7	598.1
we	598.1	598.1
were	598.1	598.3
Honey,	600.4	601.5
I	601.5	602.4
would	602.4	602.7
love	602.7	603.0
to	603.0	603.9
do	603.9	604.1
all	604.1	604.1
that	604.1	604.4
but	604.4	605.3
nothing's	605.3	605.7
changed.	605.7	606.3
Not	607.1	607.6
true.	607.6	607.9
You	608.8	609.2
don't	609.2	609.4
have	609.4	609.5
a	609.5	609.6
mustache.	609.6	609.8
But	615.4	615.8
we	615.8	615.9
still	615.9	616.0
want	616.0	616.2
different	616.2	616.5
things.	616.5	616.7
You	616.7	617.2
know	617.2	617.3
how	617.3	617.5
this	617.5	617.6
is	617.6	617.7
going	617.7	617.8
to	617.8	618.0
end?	618.0	618.1
I	619.7	620.0
didn't	620.0	620.3
know	620.3	620.4
what.	620.4	620.5
I	622.0	622.3
got	622.3	622.6
to	622.6	622.7
walk	622.7	622.8
out	622.8	623.2
of	623.2	623.3
here	623.3	623.4
right	623.4	623.6
now.	623.6	623.7
Is	626.1	626.5
getting	626.5	626.8
over.	626.8	626.9
You	626.9	627.1
was	627.1	627.2
the	627.2	627.3
hardest	627.3	627.4
thing	627.4	627.8
that	627.8	628.0
I	628.0	628.2
have	628.2	628.3
ever	628.3	628.4
had	628.4	628.8
to	628.8	628.8
do.	628.8	629.0
I	630.9	632.5
think	632.5	632.7
I	632.7	632.8
could	632.8	632.9
do	632.9	633.0
it	633.0	633.1
again.	633.1	633.2
No,	634.9	635.4
I	635.4	635.6
couldn't.	635.6	636.0
so,	642.6	643.0
how	652.6	652.8
about	652.8	652.9
one	652.9	653.1
last	653.1	653.2
game	653.2	653.6
of	653.6	653.7
racquetball?	653.7	654.0
What	660.0	661.3
is	661.3	661.3
the	661.3	661.5
norm?	661.5	662.0
That's	672.8	673.2
just	673.2	673.4
really,	673.4	673.5
really	673.5	673.7
sick.	673.7	674.0
Those	679.9	680.4
there,	680.4	680.7
but	680.7	681.0
I	681.0	681.1
don't	681.1	681.3
think	681.3	681.5
there's	681.5	681.7
anything	681.7	682.0
she	682.0	682.2
can	682.2	682.5
do.	682.5	682.7
Joey,	687.4	688.0
you	688.0	688.8
want	688.8	689.4
to	689.4	689.4
put	689.4	689.6
the	689.6	689.7
book	689.7	689.8
in	689.8	689.9
the	689.9	690.0
freezer.	690.0	690.5
Okay,	692.0	692.9
okay.	692.9	693.4
