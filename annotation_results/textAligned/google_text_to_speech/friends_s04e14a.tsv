Well,	531.9	532.4
I	532.4	532.5
didn't	532.5	532.8
see	532.8	533.0
Joshua,	533.0	533.5
but	533.5	534.9
I	534.9	535.3
did	535.3	536.1
punch	536.1	536.3
a	536.3	536.4
girl	536.4	536.5
in	536.5	536.7

other	553.9	554.1
girl	554.1	554.3
overheard	554.3	554.9

she	555.2	555.4
was	555.4	555.6
Letter	557.1	558.1

hit	559.0	559.3
her	559.3	559.3
in	559.3	559.5
the	559.5	559.5
face.	559.5	559.6
Now	559.6	560.3
she	560.3	560.6
was	560.6	560.8

in	618.4	618.9
Vermont	618.9	619.4
omigod.	619.4	620.9
When	625.4	625.8
