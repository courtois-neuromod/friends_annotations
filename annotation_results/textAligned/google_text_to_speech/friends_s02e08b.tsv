most	381.7	381.9
in	381.9	382.2
the	382.2	382.3

them	383.8	384.0
too,	384.0	384.3
but	384.3	384.9
actually	384.9	385.8
uses	385.8	386.4
them	386.4	386.7
as	386.7	387.1
reasons	387.1	387.6
not	387.6	387.9
to	387.9	388.1
be	388.1	388.2
with	388.2	388.5
you	388.5	388.7

want	390.6	390.7
to	390.7	390.8
be	390.8	390.9
with	390.9	391.2
you	391.2	391.4

all	392.3	392.5
those	392.5	392.7
things.	392.7	392.9
Well,	394.0	395.2
that's	395.2	395.4
That's	395.4	395.6
mighty	395.6	396.0
big	396.0	396.0
of	396.0	396.3
you,	396.3	396.4
Ross.	396.4	396.7
You	401.7	402.0
know	402.0	402.1
what	402.1	402.4
if	402.4	403.8
things	403.8	405.2
were	405.2	405.3
the	405.3	405.4
other	405.4	405.5
way	405.5	405.7
around?	405.7	405.9
There	405.9	406.8
is	406.8	406.9
nothing	406.9	407.5
you	407.5	407.6
can	407.6	407.8
put	407.8	408.0
on	408.0	408.1
a	408.1	408.2
list	408.2	408.4
that	408.4	408.5
would	408.5	408.7
that	408.7	408.9

be	410.4	410.5
with	410.5	410.7
you	410.7	410.9
and	410.9	412.6
I	412.6	412.8
guess	412.8	413.0
that's	413.0	413.1
the	413.1	413.3
difference	413.3	413.3
between	413.3	413.7
us.	413.7	414.1
Think	415.1	415.5
I've	415.5	415.7
never	415.7	415.8
make	415.8	416.2
a	416.2	416.2
list.	416.2	416.7
I	433.2	433.2
don't	433.2	433.7
know	433.7	433.8
how	433.8	433.9
long	433.9	434.1
you	434.1	434.2
supposed	434.2	434.4
to	434.4	434.5
wait	434.5	434.8
in	434.8	434.9
this	434.9	435.0
type	435.0	435.4
of	435.4	435.4
situation	435.4	435.7
before	435.7	436.1
you	436.1	436.3
can	436.3	436.4
talk	436.4	436.7
again.	436.7	436.8
A	439.8	440.2
little	440.2	440.4
longer.	440.4	440.7
I	446.7	447.0
want	447.0	447.2
some	447.2	447.3
of	447.3	447.4
these	447.4	447.5
recipes,	447.5	447.9
the	447.9	448.2
quantity	448.2	448.5
may	448.5	448.7
seem	448.7	448.9
just	448.9	449.0
a	449.0	449.1
little	449.1	449.3
unusual.	449.3	449.6
Like	449.6	450.9
