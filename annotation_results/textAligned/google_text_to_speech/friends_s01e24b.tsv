I	111.5	111.7
guess	111.7	112.0
I	112.0	112.1
just	112.1	112.3
had	112.3	112.5
you	112.5	112.6
pegged	112.6	112.9
as	112.9	113.1
one	113.1	113.2
of	113.2	113.3
those	113.3	113.4
guys	113.4	113.7
who	113.7	113.9
are	113.9	114.1
always	114.1	114.2
mean	114.2	114.8
to	114.8	114.8
me	114.8	115.1
but	115.1	116.2
you	116.2	116.6
You're	117.7	118.2
a	118.2	118.3
giver.	118.3	118.6
You're	118.6	120.7
like	120.7	120.9
the	120.9	121.0
most	121.0	121.2
generous	121.2	121.6
man	121.6	121.8
I	121.8	122.1
ever	122.1	122.3
met.	122.3	122.6
I	122.6	123.4
mean	123.4	123.6
you're	123.6	124.9
practically	124.9	125.4
a	125.4	125.6
woman.	125.6	126.1
You're	133.7	134.7
just	134.7	135.0
saying	135.0	135.2
that.	135.2	135.5
So	151.9	152.3
I	152.3	153.1
missed	153.1	153.4
them.	153.4	153.6
Oh,	153.6	154.4

bad	160.0	160.4
for	160.4	160.5
her.	160.5	160.7
I	160.7	160.8
really	160.8	161.0
do.	161.0	161.4
I	161.4	161.8
can	161.8	162.0
think	162.0	162.2
of	162.2	162.3
somebody	162.3	162.5
other	162.5	162.7
than	162.7	162.8
myself.	162.8	163.2

I	195.5	195.6
mean,	195.6	195.7
it's	195.7	195.9
only	195.9	196.0
a	196.0	196.1
little	196.1	196.2
bit	196.2	196.4

date.	239.7	243.5
Another	243.5	245.1
good	245.1	245.3
point.	245.3	245.5
I	248.5	248.8
mean	248.8	249.0
when	249.0	249.1
you're	249.1	249.2

And	255.8	258.3
then	258.3	258.5
what	258.5	258.7
happens	258.7	259.2
if	259.2	259.2

Sometimes	262.3	263.0

Looks	305.6	305.9
like	305.9	306.1
last	306.1	306.9
night.	306.9	307.2
I	307.2	307.7
couldn't	307.7	308.0
do	308.0	308.2
the	308.2	308.4
thing	308.4	308.6

the	323.2	323.3
parade	323.3	323.6
route.	323.6	323.8
It	330.0	330.2
was	330.2	330.3
amazing	330.3	330.9

I	339.8	341.1
was	341.1	341.3
able	341.3	341.4

appreciate	341.7	342.2
it	342.2	342.8
on	342.8	343.6
another	343.6	344.1
level.	344.1	344.5
I	347.7	348.0

Yeah.	384.2	385.3
Monica	385.3	386.9
you	386.9	387.3
don't	387.3	387.3
have	387.3	388.3
been	388.3	388.4
thinking	388.4	388.7
about	388.7	388.7
it	388.7	389.0
and	389.0	389.1
I	389.1	389.5
just	389.5	389.6
started	389.6	389.9
this.	389.9	390.2
This	390.2	390.6
whole	390.6	390.8
thing	390.8	391.2
is	391.2	391.3
just	391.3	391.4
not	391.4	391.7
a	391.7	391.8
good	391.8	391.8
idea	391.8	392.0
because	392.0	393.5
I	393.5	394.1
feel	394.1	394.5
like	394.5	394.7
I	394.7	395.9
wouldn't	395.9	396.2
be	396.2	396.5
going	396.5	396.6
out	396.6	396.9
with	396.9	397.0
him.	397.0	397.3
I	397.3	397.5
would	397.5	397.6
be	397.6	397.7
going	397.7	397.9
out	397.9	398.2
with	398.2	398.3
all	398.3	398.6
of	398.6	398.7
you	398.7	398.9
just	398.9	400.1
feel	400.1	400.3
is	400.3	400.5
pressure	400.5	400.6
and	400.6	401.1
I	401.1	401.1
don't	401.1	401.4
know,	401.4	401.5
no	401.5	401.7
pressure,	401.7	401.9
no	401.9	402.2
pressure,	402.2	402.5
nothing	402.5	405.6
even	405.6	406.0
happened	406.0	406.1
yet	406.1	406.5
and	406.5	406.8
you're	406.8	406.9
already	406.9	407.0
come.	407.0	407.6
So	407.6	407.9
I'm	407.9	408.4
not	408.4	408.6
so	408.6	409.0
not.	409.0	410.1
Okay,	410.1	410.2
I	410.2	410.4
was	410.4	410.5
a	410.5	410.6
Teensy	410.6	411.0
bit	411.0	411.1
weird	411.1	411.6
at	411.6	411.7
first	411.7	411.9
but	411.9	412.3
then	412.3	412.5
