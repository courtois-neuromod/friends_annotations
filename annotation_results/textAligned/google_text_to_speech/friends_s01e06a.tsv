When	0.0	2.3
you	2.3	2.4
get	2.4	2.6
done	2.6	2.7
understand	2.7	3.3
is	3.3	3.4
for	3.4	3.7
us,	3.7	4.0
kissing	4.0	5.1
is	5.1	5.2
as	5.2	5.4
important	5.4	5.6
as	5.6	6.1
any	6.1	6.2
part	6.2	6.5
of	6.5	6.6
it.	6.6	6.8
Siri.	11.0	11.5
Oh	13.1	13.4
yeah.	13.4	13.7
Everything	13.7	15.0
you	15.0	15.1
need	15.1	15.3
to	15.3	15.4
know	15.4	15.4
is	15.4	15.7
in	15.7	15.9
that	15.9	16.0
first	16.0	16.4
kiss.	16.4	16.7
Absolutely.	16.7	17.7
I	17.7	18.2
think	18.2	18.4
for	18.4	18.6
us	18.6	18.8
kissing	18.8	19.4
is	19.4	19.5
pretty	19.5	19.7
much	19.7	19.9
like	19.9	20.0
an	20.0	20.5
opening	20.5	20.9
act	20.9	21.1
before	21.1	25.3
it	25.3	25.5
comes	25.5	25.7
out.	25.7	25.9
And	29.2	30.3
it's	30.3	30.5
not	30.5	30.8
that	30.8	31.0
we	31.0	31.2
don't	31.2	31.3
like	31.3	31.6
the	31.6	32.3
comedian.	32.3	33.0
It's	33.0	33.3
just	33.3	33.6
that.	33.6	33.7
That's,	33.7	33.9
that's	33.9	35.5
not	35.5	35.7
why	35.7	36.6
we	36.6	36.7
bought	36.7	37.0
the	37.0	37.1
ticket.	37.1	37.6
See	39.7	40.2
the	40.2	40.3
problem	40.3	40.5
is	40.5	40.8
after	40.8	41.7
the	41.7	42.0
concert	42.0	42.4
over	42.4	42.6
matter,	42.6	42.9
how	42.9	43.0
great	43.0	43.3
the	43.3	43.4
show	43.4	43.6
was	43.6	44.2
you	44.2	44.5
girls	44.5	45.0
are	45.0	45.1
always	45.1	45.3
looking	45.3	46.1
for	46.1	46.3
the	46.3	46.4
comedian	46.4	46.7
again.	46.7	47.2
Trying	47.2	51.9
to	51.9	52.0
stay	52.0	52.2
awake.	52.2	52.5
Goodbye	56.1	56.5
spring	56.5	57.0
back	57.0	57.4
to	57.4	57.4
comedian	57.4	58.0
otherwise.	58.0	58.6
Next	58.6	58.9
time	58.9	59.0
you're	59.0	59.2
going	59.2	59.3
to	59.3	59.4
find	59.4	59.6
yourself	59.6	59.7
sitting	59.7	60.1
at	60.1	60.4
home	60.4	60.5
listening	60.5	60.9
to	60.9	61.0
that	61.0	61.2
album	61.2	61.7
alone.	61.7	62.3
Are	67.4	67.7
we	67.7	67.9
still	67.9	68.0
talking	68.0	68.2
about	68.2	68.4
sex?	68.4	68.9
It	80.4	81.8
is	81.8	82.1
good.	82.1	82.5
It's	82.5	82.8
just	82.8	82.9
that	82.9	83.2
doesn't	83.2	84.3
she	84.3	84.5
seem	84.5	84.8
a	84.8	84.8
little	84.8	85.0
angry	85.0	85.8
12?	85.8	86.9
She	86.9	87.2
has	87.2	87.3
issues.	87.3	87.5
Hey,	87.5	92.7
I'm	92.7	92.9
evolving	92.9	93.5
bag	93.5	95.6
another	95.6	95.7
women	95.7	96.1
over	96.1	96.2
the	96.2	96.3
head	96.3	96.4
with	96.4	96.5
the	96.5	96.6
club.	96.6	97.0
While	97.0	97.2
she	97.2	97.4
sits	97.4	97.7
at	97.7	97.9
home	97.9	98.0
trying	98.0	98.4
to	98.4	98.5
get	98.5	98.6
the	98.6	98.7
Mastodon,	98.7	99.3
smell	99.3	99.6
out	99.6	99.8
of	99.8	99.8
the	99.8	99.9
car.	99.9	100.0
But	100.0	100.2
it's	100.2	100.4
okay.	100.4	105.8
They	105.8	106.0
have	106.0	106.2
issues	106.2	106.5
like	106.5	106.8
Gina	107.8	108.5
glaciers	108.5	109.0
getting	109.0	109.3
kind	109.3	109.5
of	109.5	109.6
close,	109.6	119.9
I	119.9	120.1
catch	120.1	120.6

with	120.7	120.8
you	120.8	120.9
in	120.9	121.0
the	121.0	121.1
ice	121.1	121.3
age.	121.3	121.4
Can	121.4	121.8
I	121.8	121.9
say?	121.9	122.1
That	122.1	122.6
would	122.6	122.8
be	122.8	122.9
no.	122.9	123.0
Hi.	134.3	138.4
It	145.8	147.7
is	147.7	147.8
a	147.8	147.9
bad	147.9	148.0
time.	148.0	148.1
The	148.1	150.6
Stone	150.6	151.0
Age.	151.0	151.4
You	154.7	155.1
look	155.1	155.2
great.	155.2	155.4
I	157.3	157.7
hate	157.7	157.9
that.	157.9	158.1
Thanks	158.1	161.3
you	161.3	162.2
look	162.2	162.4

So	170.5	172.6
what's	172.6	172.8
new	172.8	173.0
still	173.0	173.6
well	173.6	174.7
paranoid?	174.7	183.2
I'm	188.0	188.4
pregnant.	188.4	188.7
Looks	199.1	199.7
like	199.7	199.8
she	199.8	199.9
didn't	199.9	200.2
leave	200.2	200.4
in	200.4	200.6
such	200.6	200.7
a	200.7	200.8
hurry	200.8	200.9
after	200.9	201.4
all.	201.4	201.8
I	201.8	202.6
think	202.6	202.7
this	202.7	202.9
is	202.9	203.1
the	203.1	203.2
episode	203.2	203.5
of	203.5	203.6
Three's	203.6	203.9
Company	203.9	203.9
with	203.9	204.4
some	204.4	204.7
kind	204.7	204.8
of	204.8	204.9
misunderstanding.	204.9	205.2
Then	209.6	210.0
I've	210.0	210.1
already	210.1	210.2
seen	210.2	210.5
this	210.5	210.7
one.	210.7	211.0
Are	213.5	213.9
you	213.9	214.0
sure	214.0	214.1
that?	214.1	214.2
Yeah,	214.2	215.9
sorry	215.9	216.4
the	216.4	216.5
swallowing	216.5	217.1
slowed	217.1	217.4
me	217.4	217.6
down	217.6	217.6
Pictures	219.5	220.1
of	220.1	220.2
all	220.2	220.4
the	220.4	220.4
papers	220.4	220.9
this	220.9	221.0
note.	221.0	225.7
So	225.7	225.8
I	225.8	225.9
balled	225.9	226.3
it	226.3	226.3
up	226.3	226.5
and	226.5	226.8
now	226.8	227.1
I	227.1	227.3
wish	227.3	227.4
I	227.4	227.6
was	227.6	227.8
dead.	227.8	228.1
But	230.8	231.3
that	231.3	231.4
pillow	231.4	231.8

slept	232.9	233.3
but	233.3	233.5
it's	233.5	233.6
fine.	233.6	233.9
But	235.8	236.2
I'm	236.2	236.4
sorry	236.4	236.7
guys.	236.7	236.9
I	236.9	237.0
just	237.0	237.2
want	237.2	237.5

give	237.5	237.6
them	237.6	237.8
any	237.8	237.9
more	237.9	238.1
ammunition	238.1	238.4
than	238.4	238.7
they	238.7	238.9
already	238.9	239.0
have.	239.0	239.2
Would	245.4	245.7
you	245.7	245.9
relax?	245.9	246.1
You	246.1	246.7
do	246.7	246.8
this.	246.8	246.9
Every	246.9	247.1
time	247.1	247.3
they	247.3	247.6
come	247.6	247.8
to	247.8	247.9
place	247.9	248.2
looks	248.2	248.4

You	248.7	249.1

beautiful	249.3	249.8
lasagna	249.8	250.7
here	250.7	251.0
that	251.0	251.2
looks	251.2	251.4
good.	251.4	251.6
Enough	251.6	251.7
to	251.7	252.0
avoid	252.0	253.3
touching.	253.3	253.7
Monica,	257.6	258.3
Monica,	258.3	261.2
you're	261.2	262.3

had	284.4	284.6
some	284.6	284.8
big	284.8	284.8
ceremony	284.8	285.3
before	285.3	285.7
I	285.7	285.9
was	285.9	286.0
born.	286.0	286.1

it	317.5	317.6
back	317.6	317.7
to	317.7	318.1
him.	318.1	318.3
I	318.3	319.3
barely	319.3	319.7
remember	319.7	320.1
me.	320.1	320.3
I'm	320.3	320.6
the	320.6	320.6
girl	320.6	320.8
in	320.8	320.9
The	320.9	321.0
Veil	321.0	321.3
that	321.3	321.3
stomped	321.3	321.7
on	321.7	321.8
your	321.8	321.9
heart	321.9	322.2
in	322.2	322.3
front	322.3	322.4

ring	326.2	326.7
without	326.7	327.0
the	327.0	327.3
ring	327.3	327.8
which	327.8	328.0
makes	328.0	328.3
it	328.3	328.4
so	328.4	328.6
much	328.6	328.8
harder	328.8	329.1
to	329.1	330.0
find	330.0	332.8
it	332.8	333.0
back	333.0	337.1
to	337.1	337.4
him.	337.4	337.8
It'll	337.8	338.0
all	338.0	338.2
be	338.2	338.3
over	338.3	338.5

ice	339.3	339.5
cream.	339.5	339.6
All	347.4	347.8
right,	347.8	347.9
once	347.9	348.1

have	348.2	348.4
it	348.4	348.5
on	348.5	348.6
last	348.6	348.9
probably	348.9	350.1
right	350.1	350.3
before	350.3	350.4
she	350.4	350.7
lost	350.7	350.9
it.	350.9	351.3
Don't	353.8	354.2

this	359.6	359.7
morning.	359.7	359.9
I	359.9	361.3

I	361.6	361.8
had	361.8	362.1

You	382.2	382.3
know,	382.3	382.5
that's	382.5	382.9
not	382.9	383.0
how	383.0	383.1
you	383.1	383.2
look	383.2	383.4
for	383.4	383.5
an	383.5	383.6
engagement	383.6	384.0
ring	384.0	384.2

lasagna.	384.3	384.9
And	388.2	388.6

Boys.	391.1	391.6
We're	393.2	393.6
going	393.6	393.9

That's	419.6	419.9
another	419.9	420.1
two	420.1	420.4
