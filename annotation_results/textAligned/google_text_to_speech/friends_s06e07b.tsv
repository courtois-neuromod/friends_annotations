bad	8.8	9.0
it's	9.0	9.6
worse.	9.6	10.1
The	10.1	10.8
only	10.8	11.0
thing	11.0	11.1
is	11.1	11.2
getting	11.2	11.3

If	24.5	24.9
you	24.9	25.1
can	25.1	25.3
kill	25.3	25.4
me,	25.4	25.6
when	25.6	26.9
the	26.9	27.0
phone	27.0	27.2
is	27.2	27.3
facing	27.3	27.7
the	27.7	27.8
other	27.8	27.9

Okay,	33.8	34.1

This	34.6	34.8
is	34.8	34.9
under	34.9	35.1
control.	35.1	35.8
We	35.8	36.0
should	36.0	36.1
do,	36.1	36.2
we	36.2	36.6
should	36.6	36.7
start	36.7	36.9

big	37.1	37.2
stuff,	37.2	37.5
you	37.5	37.8

just	53.6	53.7
walk	53.7	54.1
over	54.1	54.3

Okay,	58.9	59.4

Do	135.1	135.3

repel	135.6	136.2
women.	136.2	136.8
Okay,	136.8	137.3
that	137.3	137.5
is	137.5	137.7
completely	137.7	138.3
untrue.	138.3	138.6
Yes,	138.6	139.9
we	139.9	140.1
do,	140.1	140.4
my	140.4	140.7
man.	140.7	141.1
Never	142.0	142.6
went	142.6	142.9
back	142.9	143.0

to	143.9	144.0
the	144.0	144.0
spring	144.0	144.5
dance.	144.5	144.6
And	144.6	145.0

walked	145.1	145.4
right	145.4	145.5
up	145.5	145.8
to	145.8	145.8
that	145.8	146.0
girl.	146.0	146.3
You	146.3	146.4
like	146.4	146.7
and	146.7	146.8
you	146.8	146.9
could	146.9	147.0
not	147.0	147.3
stop	147.3	147.7
talking	147.7	147.9
about	147.9	148.2
the	148.2	148.4
Irish	148.4	148.7
potato	148.7	149.1
famine,	149.1	149.2

Yeah,	159.7	160.0
Monica	160.0	160.3
doesn't	160.3	160.7
like	160.7	160.9
that,	160.9	161.0
either.	161.0	161.1
Maybe	161.1	161.4
I	161.4	161.6
should	161.6	161.7
stop	161.7	162.0
doing	162.0	162.2
that.	162.2	162.5
Do	163.6	164.0
you	164.0	164.2
know	164.2	164.2
what	164.2	164.5
girls	164.5	164.9
don't	164.9	165.2
like	165.2	165.4

I	166.0	166.0
start	166.0	166.3
talking	166.3	166.4
about	166.4	166.7
science,	166.7	167.3
that's	167.3	167.4
not	167.4	167.6
specific	167.6	167.8
to	167.8	168.1
girls?	168.1	168.5
This	171.1	171.5
is	171.5	171.7
great.	171.7	172.0
What?	172.0	172.2
What?	172.2	172.3
Oh,	172.8	173.4
they	173.4	173.7
don't	173.7	173.9
like	173.9	174.0
it	174.0	174.1
when	174.1	174.3
you	174.3	174.3
correct	174.3	174.7
their	174.7	174.8
grammar	174.8	175.2
and	175.2	175.9
they	175.9	175.9
don't	175.9	176.1
like	176.1	176.2
it	176.2	176.4
when	176.4	176.5
you	176.5	176.6
explain	176.6	177.3
why	177.3	177.6
your	177.6	177.7
jokes	177.7	178.1
are	178.1	178.2
funny.	178.2	178.5
No,	180.3	180.5
they	180.5	180.7
don't	180.7	180.8
like	180.8	181.1
it	181.1	181.1
when	181.1	181.3
you	181.3	181.4
keep	181.4	181.6
asking	181.6	181.9
them,	181.9	182.4
if	182.4	182.5
they	182.5	182.7
like	182.7	183.0
you.	183.0	183.1
I'm	184.3	185.5
so	185.5	185.8
lucky.	185.8	186.0
I	186.0	186.3
have	186.3	186.5
Monica.	186.5	186.8
Sure.	195.6	196.2
Okay.	196.2	197.3
TV.	202.4	202.9
Look,	202.9	203.1
I	203.1	203.3
just	203.3	203.3
wanted	203.3	203.9
to	203.9	204.0
say	204.0	204.2
that.	204.2	204.4
I'm	204.4	204.5
sorry,	204.5	204.7
okay,	204.7	205.7
I	205.7	205.9
handled	205.9	206.5
the	206.5	207.0
situation	207.0	207.4
horribly	207.4	208.4
and	208.4	208.6
I	208.6	209.0
should	209.0	209.2
not	209.2	209.4
have	209.4	209.6
lied	209.6	210.0
to	210.0	210.2
you.	210.2	210.3
So,	211.7	212.1
what	212.1	212.3
should	212.3	212.5
you	212.5	212.7
have	212.7	212.8
done?	212.8	213.2
I	213.2	214.6
should	214.6	214.9
have	214.9	215.0
told	215.0	215.3
you	215.3	215.4
the	215.4	215.6
truth,	215.6	215.6
which	215.6	217.5
is	217.5	217.9
you	220.4	220.8
know,	220.8	220.9
the	220.9	221.1
reason	221.1	221.6
that	221.6	221.8
I	221.8	222.0
didn't	222.0	222.3
want	222.3	222.3
to	222.3	222.5
go	222.5	222.6
running	222.6	222.8
with	222.8	223.0
you	223.0	223.3
is	223.3	223.6
because	223.6	225.4
well	225.4	226.4
you	226.4	226.5
know	226.5	226.6
the	226.6	226.7
way	226.7	226.9
that	226.9	227.0
you	227.0	227.1
run	227.1	227.4
is	227.4	227.5
just	227.5	227.5
a	227.5	227.7
little	227.7	227.9
So	231.9	232.3
embarrassing	232.3	233.6
people	233.6	233.9
were	233.9	234.1
looking	234.1	234.4
at	234.4	234.5
us,	234.5	234.6
like	234.6	234.7
we	234.7	234.8
were	234.8	234.9
crazy.	234.9	235.3
Why	235.3	236.1
do	236.1	236.3
you	236.3	236.4
care?	236.4	236.8
Because	236.8	237.3
they're	237.3	237.7
people	237.7	238.1
Songs	240.0	240.3
that	240.3	240.4
you	240.4	240.5
don't	240.5	240.7
know	240.7	240.9
and	240.9	241.0
will	241.0	241.2
never	241.2	241.2
see	241.2	241.6
again	241.6	241.7
but	241.7	242.7
still	242.7	243.2
they	243.2	243.4
are	243.4	243.6
people	243.6	243.9
with	243.9	245.1
eyes.	245.1	245.6
I	245.6	248.0
didn't	248.0	248.3
get	248.3	248.5
embarrassed	248.5	249.1
running	249.1	249.4
next	249.4	249.6
to	249.6	249.8
miss.	249.8	250.0
But	250.9	254.2
oh	254.2	254.6
okay.	254.6	255.1
No	255.1	255.7
no	255.7	255.8
I	255.8	256.0
can	256.0	256.1
see	256.1	256.4
why	256.4	256.7
running	256.7	257.5
with	257.5	257.6
me	257.6	257.9
would	257.9	258.1
be	258.1	258.2
embarrassing	258.2	258.8
to	258.8	259.0
you.	259.0	259.1
Yeah.	259.1	259.9
Not	263.3	263.7
that	263.7	263.9
I	263.9	264.0
am	264.0	267.2
not	267.2	267.7
uptight.	267.7	268.9
That's	272.0	272.5
okay.	272.5	272.9
Rachel,	272.9	273.3
I'm	273.3	273.5
not	273.5	273.5
judging	273.5	274.1
you.	274.1	274.2
That's	274.2	274.6
just	274.6	274.7
who	274.7	275.0
you	275.0	275.1
are	275.1	275.2
me.	275.2	276.3
I'm	276.3	276.6
more	276.6	276.8
free.	276.8	277.0

lovable	443.1	443.6
clearly,	443.6	445.4
there's	445.4	445.8
a	445.8	445.9
Vibe	445.9	446.3
going	446.3	446.6
on	446.6	446.8
but	446.8	446.9
we're	446.9	449.1
roommates	449.1	449.5
and	449.5	450.4
it's	450.4	450.5
a	450.5	450.6
huge	450.6	450.8
mistake	450.8	451.2
for	451.2	451.7

continue	451.9	452.3
down	452.3	453.3
this	453.3	453.5
road.	453.5	454.0
The	461.5	462.8
question	462.8	463.3
is,	463.3	463.6
what	463.6	464.5
do	464.5	464.6

think	465.8	465.9
there	465.9	466.1
is	466.1	466.2
anything	466.2	466.6
to	466.6	466.8
do	466.8	467.2
and	467.2	467.7

think	467.9	468.1
you're	468.1	468.2
really	468.2	468.3
sweet	468.3	468.8
but	468.8	470.2
I'm	470.2	470.3
just	470.3	470.5

in	471.2	471.4
you	471.4	471.5

way	490.4	490.8
about	490.8	490.9
you.	490.9	491.3
Oh,	492.7	494.1

see	494.7	495.2
what	495.2	495.3
happened	495.3	496.5
is	496.5	497.8
because	497.8	498.0
I	498.0	498.3

me.	501.3	501.5
You'd	501.5	502.4
feel	502.4	502.7
a	502.7	502.7
lot	502.7	503.2
different	503.2	503.8
if	503.8	504.1
I	504.1	504.3

Haha.	573.1	573.6
Why	581.0	581.4

everything	581.5	581.7
different?	581.7	581.9
I	586.6	587.0

see	587.5	587.5
anything	587.5	588.1
different	588.1	588.2
other	588.2	588.6
than	588.6	588.8
the	588.8	588.9
fact,	588.9	589.0
the	589.0	589.3
room	589.3	589.5
that's	589.5	589.6
so	589.6	589.8
much	589.8	590.0
brighter	590.0	590.2
when	590.2	591.0
you	591.0	591.1
came	591.1	591.3
into	591.3	591.5
it.	591.5	591.8
Don't	600.8	601.8
don't	601.8	602.5
be	602.5	602.5
mad	602.5	602.8
okay	602.8	603.2

of	668.4	668.7
functions	668.7	669.0
as	669.0	669.4
an	669.4	669.5
actual	669.5	669.8

But	682.8	683.2
is	683.2	683.4
so	683.4	683.7
Dineen.	683.7	685.3
Do	685.3	685.4
you	685.4	685.9
know	685.9	686.1
what	686.1	686.3
we're	686.3	687.1
doing	687.1	687.2
right	687.2	687.6
now?	687.6	687.7
You	689.0	689.4
and	689.4	689.5
I	689.5	689.6
were	689.6	689.8
at	689.8	689.9
work	689.9	690.1
interfacing.	690.1	690.9
Yeah,	693.2	693.6
I	693.6	694.2
got	694.2	694.4
to	694.4	694.4
go.	694.4	694.6
