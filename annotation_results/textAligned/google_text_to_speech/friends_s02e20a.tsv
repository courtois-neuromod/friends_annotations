just,	468.0	469.1
not	469.1	469.6

Look,	481.5	481.9

might	542.4	542.5
as	542.5	542.6
well	542.6	542.7
try	542.7	543.0
which	543.0	548.2
I	548.2	548.3
thought	548.3	548.5
you	548.5	548.7
two	548.7	549.8
secondary	549.8	551.0
caregiver	551.0	551.8
but	551.8	552.2
Hey,	555.6	556.0
would	556.0	556.2
you	556.2	556.3
what	556.3	556.5
would	556.5	556.6
you	556.6	556.7
hold	556.7	556.9
him	556.9	557.0
for	557.0	557.2
a	557.2	557.2
second	557.2	557.5
cuz	557.5	557.7
I	557.7	557.8
got	557.8	557.9
to	557.9	558.2
take	558.2	558.3
this	558.3	558.5
off.	558.5	558.7
What	567.2	567.6
are	567.6	567.6
you	567.6	567.7
doing?	567.7	567.9
I'm	567.9	569.2
holding	569.2	569.6
down.	569.6	569.8
He's	569.8	573.3
a	573.3	573.4
baby.	573.4	573.7
Not	573.7	573.9
a	573.9	573.9
bomb.	573.9	574.3
What	575.9	577.0
does	577.0	577.2
Holden	577.2	577.4
like	577.4	577.6
in	577.6	577.6
the	577.6	577.8
football?	577.8	578.1
This	578.1	579.4
is	579.4	579.7
how	579.7	579.9
I	579.9	580.0
would	580.0	580.2
hold	580.2	580.3
a	580.3	580.4
football	580.4	581.0
around	581.0	587.9
them.	587.9	588.4
I	588.4	589.0
mean,	589.0	589.2
you	589.2	589.3
know,	589.3	589.4
since	589.4	589.6
I	589.6	589.7
was	589.7	589.8
10	589.8	592.0
big	592.0	592.1
deal,	592.1	592.5
definitely	592.5	593.7
I'm	593.7	594.2
sure	594.2	594.4
you'll	594.4	594.5
feel	594.5	594.6
totally	594.6	595.1
different	595.1	595.2
when	595.2	595.5
it's	595.5	595.6
on	595.6	595.7
baby.	595.7	596.1
What	597.1	597.5
you	597.5	600.2
think	600.2	600.7
about	600.7	600.7
stuff	600.7	601.0
like	601.0	601.2
that?	601.2	601.3
Actually,	601.3	606.0
I	606.0	606.3
kind	606.3	607.5
of	607.5	607.5
think	607.5	607.7
we'll	607.7	608.4
have	608.4	608.5
two	608.5	608.8
babies.	608.8	609.4
Two	610.6	611.0
babies,	611.0	612.4
a	612.4	614.6
boy	614.6	614.8
and	614.8	615.3
a	615.3	615.3
girl.	615.3	615.4
Hopefully,	615.4	615.8
the	615.8	616.0
girl	616.0	616.3
will	616.3	616.4
come	616.4	616.4
first	616.4	616.7
so	616.7	616.9
been	616.9	617.2
here,	617.2	617.3
will	617.3	617.5
feel	617.5	617.7
too	617.7	617.8
competitive.	617.8	618.2
Then	620.8	622.5
what's	622.5	622.7
going	622.7	622.8
to	622.8	622.9
happen?	622.9	623.0
Well	623.0	624.0
you	624.0	624.1
won't	624.1	624.4
want	624.4	624.7
to	624.7	624.8
raise	624.8	625.0
kids	625.0	625.2
in	625.2	625.4
the	625.4	625.4
city	625.4	625.7
so	625.7	626.2
we'll	626.2	626.4
probably	626.4	626.5
move	626.5	626.8
to	626.8	627.0
US	627.0	627.3
Car	627.3	627.5
staff.	627.5	627.9
Haha.	628.5	629.2
Yeah,	629.2	629.4
that	629.4	629.7
way	629.7	629.9
I	629.9	630.1
figure	630.1	630.3
it,	630.3	630.5
you	630.5	630.7
know	630.7	630.8
we'll	630.8	630.9
be	630.9	631.0
far	631.0	631.2
enough	631.2	631.2
away	631.2	631.4
from	631.4	631.7
her	631.7	631.8
parents	631.8	632.1
and	632.1	632.3
we	632.3	632.3
don't	632.3	632.4
have	632.4	632.5
to	632.5	632.6
see	632.6	632.8
them	632.8	632.9
all	632.9	633.0
the	633.0	633.1
time	633.1	633.2
but	633.2	633.5
close	633.5	633.7
enough	633.7	633.8
that	633.8	634.0
they	634.0	634.1
can	634.1	634.3
come	634.3	634.4
over	634.4	634.5
and	634.5	634.7
babysit	634.7	635.1
whenever	635.1	635.4
we	635.4	635.5
want.	635.5	635.8
And	635.8	636.1
yes,	636.1	636.4
I	636.4	636.5
know	636.5	636.7
the	636.7	636.9
taxes	636.9	637.3
are	637.3	637.4
a	637.4	637.4
little	637.4	637.6
higher	637.6	637.9
than	637.9	638.0
let's	638.0	638.3
say	638.3	638.4
Nassau	638.4	638.8
County	638.8	639.3
but	639.3	639.6
System.	640.9	641.3
Supposedly	641.3	641.8
Greg	641.8	642.2
Wow,	645.5	646.0
that's	646.0	646.2
great.	646.2	646.5
Great	646.5	647.5
Okay,	648.7	649.2
