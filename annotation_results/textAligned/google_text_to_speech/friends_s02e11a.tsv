nothing	156.4	156.9
to	156.9	157.1
do	157.1	157.3
with.	157.3	157.5
It's	157.5	157.7

She's	157.9	158.2
my	158.2	158.3
ex-wife.	158.3	158.8
If,	158.8	159.2

guy,	160.2	160.5
none	160.5	161.0
of	161.0	161.0
you	161.0	161.1
would	161.1	161.2
expect	161.2	161.5
me	161.5	161.7
to	161.7	161.7
be	161.7	161.9
there	161.9	162.0
if	162.0	162.6
she	162.6	162.6
would	162.6	162.9
marry	162.9	162.9
a	162.9	163.1
guy.	163.1	163.4
She'd	163.4	163.8
be	163.8	164.0
the	164.0	165.0
worst	165.0	165.3
lesbian	165.3	165.7
No,	170.6	170.9

Wow.	174.1	174.9
She's	174.9	175.3

she's	176.8	177.4
really	177.4	177.6
nice	177.6	177.9

She	178.2	178.9

me	179.1	179.2
all	179.2	179.4
about,	179.4	179.4
you	179.4	179.9
know,	179.9	180.0
how	180.0	180.4
to	180.4	180.5
work	180.5	180.8
with	180.8	180.9
the	180.9	181.0
cameras	181.0	181.8
and	181.8	182.0
smell	182.0	182.3
the	182.3	182.4
fart	182.4	182.8
acting	182.8	183.3
up.	183.3	186.9
Sorry.	186.9	187.0
Smell	189.3	189.7
the	189.7	189.8
fart	189.8	190.0
acting.	190.0	190.5
It's	192.6	193.1
like,	193.1	193.2
you	193.2	193.9
got	193.9	193.9
so	193.9	194.3
many	194.3	194.5
lines	194.5	195.1
to	195.1	195.2
learn	195.2	195.4
so	195.4	195.7
fast	195.7	195.9
that	195.9	196.4
sometimes	196.4	197.5
you	197.5	197.6
need	197.6	197.7
a	197.7	197.9
minute	197.9	198.0
to	198.0	198.2
remember	198.2	198.4
you	198.4	198.6
next	198.6	198.9
one.	198.9	199.1
So	199.1	199.8
while	199.8	200.0
you	200.0	200.2
thinking	200.2	200.6
of	200.6	200.7
it,	200.7	200.9
you	200.9	201.3
take	201.3	201.5
this	201.5	201.7
big	201.7	202.0
pause.	202.0	202.9
When	202.9	203.1
you	203.1	203.2
look	203.2	203.3
all	203.3	203.5
intense,	203.5	204.2
you	204.2	204.8
don't	204.8	205.0
like	205.0	205.1
this.	205.1	205.2
Okay.	206.3	211.0
Who	212.8	213.2
is	213.2	213.4
Mikey?	213.4	213.6
As	217.6	218.1
well	218.1	218.3
as	218.3	218.4
I'm	218.4	219.9
Dr.	219.9	220.2
Draper	220.2	220.5
more	220.5	220.8
and	220.8	221.0
your	221.0	221.1
sisters	221.1	221.5
neurosurgeon.	221.5	222.2
I'm	224.7	224.9
afraid	224.9	225.0
the	225.0	225.2
situation	225.2	225.5
is	225.5	225.8
much	225.8	226.0
more	226.0	226.2
dire	226.2	226.7
than	226.7	226.8
we'd	226.8	227.1
expected.	227.1	227.6
Your	227.6	228.9
sister	228.9	229.2
is	229.2	229.3
suffering	229.3	229.8
from	229.8	230.0
a	230.0	230.2
a	235.2	236.9
subchorionic	236.9	237.5
hematoma.	237.5	238.4
Perhaps	240.6	241.4
we	241.4	242.3
can	242.3	242.4
discuss	242.4	242.8
this	242.8	243.0
further	243.0	243.4
over	243.4	243.6
coffee.	243.6	244.2
I	250.8	251.3
thought	251.3	254.6
you	254.6	254.7
were	254.7	254.8
actually	254.8	255.0
trying	255.0	255.3

I	270.9	271.0
got	271.0	271.1
a	271.1	271.2

Okay?	285.8	285.9

One	290.3	290.7

it.	321.2	321.5
The	325.0	325.7
weirdest	325.7	326.7
thing	326.7	326.7
was,	326.7	327.0
okay.	327.0	327.6

I	334.2	335.0
don't	335.0	335.1
think	335.1	335.4
it	335.4	335.5
went	335.5	335.7
very	335.7	336.0
far.	336.0	336.3
What	338.3	338.6
do	338.6	338.9
you	338.9	339.0
mean?	339.0	339.2
I	339.2	340.4
think	340.4	341.1
it	341.1	341.2
went	341.2	341.4
into	341.4	341.6
me.	341.6	341.9
So	350.6	352.0
hard,	352.0	352.5
I	352.5	352.9
can't	352.9	353.2
decide	353.2	353.5
between	353.5	353.6
the	353.6	353.9
lamb	353.9	354.2
or	354.2	354.4
duck.	354.4	354.8
Clams	354.8	355.8
are	355.8	356.0
scarier	356.0	356.5
otherwise	356.5	357.4
the	357.4	357.5
movie	357.5	357.8
would	357.8	357.9
have	357.9	358.0
been	358.0	358.1
called	358.1	358.3
Silence	358.3	358.7
of	358.7	358.8
the	358.8	358.8
Ducks.	358.8	359.3
Okay,	361.7	362.2
who	362.2	362.4
ordered	362.4	362.7
what	362.7	363.0
I	363.0	364.0
believe?	364.0	364.3
I	364.3	364.5
had	364.5	364.8
the	364.8	365.0
half-drunk	365.0	365.5
cappuccino	365.5	366.2
with	366.2	366.3
the	366.3	366.5
lipstick	366.5	366.9
on	366.9	367.1
the	367.1	367.2
rim.	367.2	367.5
Yes.	368.4	368.9
And	368.9	369.1
this	369.1	369.2
with	369.2	369.5
the	369.5	369.7
cigarette	369.7	370.1
butt	370.1	370.3
in	370.3	370.4
it,	370.4	370.6
is	370.6	370.8
that	370.8	370.9
decaf.	370.9	371.5
You	379.0	379.2
think	379.2	379.4
that?	379.4	379.6
Because	379.6	379.6
I	379.6	379.9
didn't	379.9	380.1
marry	380.1	380.3
Barry.	380.3	380.7
My	380.7	380.8
life	380.8	381.1
is	381.1	381.2
total.	381.2	381.5
Crap.	381.5	381.7
You	381.7	382.1
know?	382.1	382.1
We'll	382.1	382.8
talk	382.8	382.9
about	382.9	383.2
crap.	383.2	383.8
Try	383.8	384.2
listening	384.2	384.6
to	384.6	384.8
Stella.	384.8	385.1
Need	385.1	385.4
me	385.4	385.6
until	385.6	385.8
the	385.8	385.9
story	385.9	386.3
of	386.3	386.4
her	386.4	386.6
and	386.6	386.8
Rod	386.8	386.9
Steiger	386.9	387.4
for	387.4	387.6
the	387.6	387.8
hundredth	387.8	388.2
time.	388.2	388.3
I'm	393.5	393.9
sorry	393.9	394.6
to	394.6	395.6
hear	395.6	396.5
the	396.5	396.6
stuff	396.6	396.8
she	396.8	397.0
says	397.0	397.3
in	397.3	397.4
my	397.4	397.5
head.	397.5	397.8
Steve's	401.2	402.4
how	402.4	403.3
long	403.3	403.5
you	403.5	403.6
think	403.6	403.8
this	403.8	403.8
lady	403.8	404.1
will	404.1	404.3
be	404.3	404.4
with	404.4	404.6
us?	404.6	404.7
I	406.0	406.3
don't	406.3	406.5
know,	406.5	406.7
and	406.7	407.4
she	407.4	407.6
obviously	407.6	407.8
has	407.8	408.3
some	408.3	408.5
kind	408.5	408.7
of	408.7	408.8
Unfinished	408.8	409.1
Business	409.1	409.5
setup.	409.5	410.3
There	414.1	414.7
she	414.7	414.9
is.	414.9	415.1
So	423.4	423.8
this	423.8	424.2
is	424.2	424.4
where	424.4	424.6
you	424.6	425.1
were	425.1	425.5
wonderful.	425.5	428.0
Is	428.0	429.1
it	429.1	429.2
a	429.2	429.3
living	429.3	429.7
room?	429.7	430.1
Is	430.1	430.2
it	430.2	430.3
a	430.3	430.4
restaurant	430.4	430.9
who	430.9	431.6
can	431.6	431.8
tell.	431.8	432.2
But	432.2	433.6
I	433.6	433.7
guess	433.7	434.0
that's	434.0	434.1
pretty	434.1	435.5
much	435.5	435.8
Last	436.8	441.4
time	441.4	441.6
I	441.6	441.7
saw	441.7	442.0
you	442.0	442.3
was	442.3	442.4
either	442.4	442.7
be	442.7	443.0
eaten.	443.0	443.5
This	445.9	446.3
is	446.3	446.5
Joey	446.5	446.9
Phoebe	446.9	448.4
and	448.4	449.2
this	449.2	449.3
is	449.3	449.5
Chandler.	449.5	450.1
And	450.1	450.6
you	450.6	450.7
remember	450.7	451.0
Rafael	451.0	451.7
and	451.7	451.9
Lola.	451.9	452.3
You	456.7	456.9
think	456.9	457.1
of	457.1	457.2
my	457.2	457.4
daughter	457.4	457.9
in	457.9	458.4
the	458.4	458.6
apron,	458.6	459.6
with	459.6	459.9
the	459.9	460.0
big	460.0	460.4
job,	460.4	461.3
if	461.3	464.5
you	464.5	464.8
didn't	464.8	465.1
pour	465.1	465.3
the	465.3	465.5
coffee,	465.5	465.7
no	465.7	466.3
one	466.3	466.6
would	466.6	466.7
have	466.7	466.9
anything	466.9	467.3
to	467.3	467.5
drink.	467.5	467.9
Believe	467.9	469.6
me,	469.6	469.8
sometimes	469.8	470.3
that	470.3	470.4
happens.	470.4	471.0
This	473.7	473.9
is	473.9	474.1
just	474.1	474.4
so	474.4	474.5
exciting.	474.5	474.7
I	474.7	476.2
never	476.2	476.4
worked.	476.4	477.0
I	477.0	477.4
went	477.4	477.9
straight	477.9	478.2
from	478.2	478.5
my	478.5	478.7
father's	478.7	479.2
house	479.2	479.4
to	479.4	479.6
the	479.6	479.7
sorority	479.7	480.2
house	480.2	480.4
to	480.4	480.6
my	480.6	480.7
husband's	480.7	481.2
house.	481.2	481.5
I	481.5	482.1
am	482.1	482.3
just	482.3	482.8
so	482.8	483.0
proud	483.0	483.5
of	483.5	483.9
you.	483.9	484.3
Yes,	484.3	486.2
we'll	486.2	488.6
have	488.6	488.7
lunch	488.7	489.1
will	489.1	489.7
do	489.7	489.9
whatever	489.9	492.1
you	492.1	492.5
want.	492.5	493.0
I	493.0	499.3
know	499.3	499.6
who	499.6	499.8
it	499.8	500.0
is.	500.0	500.1
You	500.1	500.3
remind	500.3	500.7
me	500.7	500.9
of	500.9	501.1
Evelyn's	501.1	502.1
armor	502.1	502.7

she	503.9	504.1
got	504.1	504.2
the	504.2	504.4
lousy	504.4	504.7
facelift.	504.7	505.4
Now,	505.4	505.5
she	505.5	505.7
looks	505.7	505.9
like	505.9	506.1
Soupy	506.1	506.4
Sales.	506.4	506.7
Who's	511.2	513.4

Nude	522.6	523.5

Playing	523.8	524.1

cello.	524.2	524.5
Yeah,	526.8	527.2
well	527.2	527.4
just	527.4	527.5
be	527.5	527.7
glad	527.7	527.8
it's	527.8	528.1
not	528.1	528.2
playing	528.2	528.6
a	528.6	528.6
smaller	528.6	529.0
instrument.	529.0	529.2
You	533.2	534.2
have	534.2	534.6
some	534.6	535.0
life	535.0	535.4
here,	535.4	535.7
sweetie.	535.7	536.3
I'm	536.3	536.6
on	536.6	537.4
my	537.4	537.6
relays.	537.6	537.9
You	537.9	538.1
and	538.1	538.2
Danny	538.2	538.4
were	538.4	538.5
upset	538.5	538.9
when	538.9	539.0
I	539.0	539.1
didn't	539.1	539.3
Mary	539.3	539.5
Berry	539.5	539.9
and	539.9	540.0
get	540.0	540.2
the	540.2	540.3
big	540.3	540.4
house	540.4	540.7
in	540.7	540.8
the	540.8	540.9
suburbs	540.9	541.3
of	541.3	541.5
all	541.5	541.7
the	541.7	541.8
security	541.8	542.3
and	542.3	542.4
everything.	542.4	542.6
But	542.6	543.2
this	543.2	544.0
is	544.0	544.1
just	544.1	544.3
so	544.3	544.6
much	544.6	544.8
better	544.8	545.1
for	545.1	545.3
me,	545.3	545.4
you	545.4	545.6
know,	545.6	545.8
I	545.8	546.2
do	546.2	546.7
know	546.7	547.0
you	547.0	548.2
didn't	548.2	548.5
love	548.5	548.5
very	548.5	549.2
honey.	549.2	549.4
And	549.4	550.4
I've	550.4	550.5
never	550.5	550.8
seen	550.8	551.0
you	551.0	551.3
this	551.3	551.5
happy.	551.5	551.8
I	551.8	553.1
look	553.1	553.5
at	553.5	553.7
you	553.7	553.8
and	553.8	553.9
I	553.9	554.1
think	554.1	554.3
this	554.3	555.0
is	555.0	555.1
what	555.1	555.4
I	555.4	555.5
want.	555.5	556.0
For	558.6	559.0
me,	559.0	559.9
not	559.9	562.5
just	562.5	562.9
for	562.9	563.2
you.	563.2	563.4
What?	563.4	564.3
What	564.3	564.5
do	564.5	564.6
you	564.6	564.6
mean?	564.6	564.6
I	566.0	566.3
am	566.3	566.5
considering	566.5	568.2
leaving	568.2	569.1
your	569.1	569.5

All	573.0	573.4
right,	573.4	573.7
tell	573.7	574.4
me	574.4	574.5

this	574.6	574.7
is	574.7	574.8
too	574.8	575.0
cute.	575.0	575.1
Lesbian	575.1	576.3
wedding	576.3	576.7
chicken	576.7	577.6
breast.	577.6	578.1
Okay,	582.6	583.1
I	583.1	584.2
think	584.2	584.4
I'm	584.4	584.5
going	584.5	584.7
to	584.7	584.7
be	584.7	584.8
sick,	584.8	585.2
why	585.2	586.2
not?	586.2	586.9
Like	586.9	587.1
I'm	587.1	587.2
putting	587.2	587.3

Oh	591.3	591.7

What	597.4	597.6
can	597.6	597.7
I	597.7	597.9
do?	597.9	598.1
Do	598.1	598.2

want	599.1	599.1
me	599.1	599.4

those	599.9	600.1
little	600.1	600.3
marshmallow	600.3	601.1
treats?	601.1	601.5
You	601.5	601.6
used	601.6	601.8
to	601.8	601.9
like	601.9	602.3
I	603.3	603.6
can	603.6	603.8
call	603.8	604.1
up,	604.1	604.2
Carmelo	604.2	604.6
and	604.6	604.9
find	604.9	605.2
out	605.2	605.3
how	605.3	605.6
Mom.	607.8	608.2
I	608.2	608.3
just	608.3	608.3
don't	608.3	608.7
understand	608.7	609.3
if	609.3	609.4
you	609.4	609.6
were	609.6	609.9
happy.	609.9	610.5
Yeah,	610.5	611.1
well,	611.1	611.5
so	611.5	611.8
did	611.8	612.0
I,	612.0	612.1
but	612.1	613.7
you	613.7	614.2
know	614.2	614.4
how	614.4	614.5
sometimes	614.5	614.9
you're	614.9	615.3
driving	615.3	615.8
on	615.8	616.0
the	616.0	616.1
highway	616.1	616.2
and	616.2	617.2
you	617.2	617.3
get	617.3	617.6
home	617.6	617.8
and	617.8	618.4
you	618.4	618.6
can't	618.6	618.9
actually	618.9	619.3
remember	619.3	619.7
having	619.7	620.3
driven	620.3	620.6
there,	620.6	620.9
What	621.4	622.8
kind	622.8	623.1
of	623.1	623.2
what	623.2	623.3
my	623.3	623.4
life's	623.4	623.8
been	623.8	623.9
like?	623.9	624.0
Listen	625.8	626.4
to	626.4	626.5
radio	626.5	626.9
more.	626.9	627.4
Wish	629.1	629.6
it	629.6	629.7
was	629.7	629.9
that	629.9	629.9
easy.	629.9	630.2
But	630.2	631.1
then	631.1	631.2
I	631.2	631.3
see	631.3	631.7
you	631.7	631.9
here.	631.9	632.4
And	632.4	632.6
I	632.6	632.7
keep	632.7	633.1
thinking	633.1	633.6
I	633.6	634.0
can,	634.0	634.2
I	634.2	634.5
have	634.5	634.7
this,	634.7	635.1
I	635.1	635.8
want	635.8	636.2
Adventures.	636.2	637.0
I	637.0	637.1
want	637.1	637.3
to	637.3	637.4
hang	637.4	637.7
out.	637.7	637.9
I	637.9	638.5
want	638.5	638.6
to	638.6	638.8
Chandler.	638.8	639.4
Mom,	641.9	643.1
believe	643.1	643.6
me.	643.6	643.8
Chandler	643.8	644.3
is	644.3	644.7
no	644.7	645.1
reason	645.1	645.6
to	645.6	645.7
leave	645.7	646.0
Daddy.	646.0	646.5
I	646.5	646.6
mean,	646.6	646.8
you	648.5	648.8
think	648.8	649.1
it	649.1	649.3
just	649.3	649.4
looks	649.4	649.5
like	649.5	649.8
I'm	649.8	650.0
having	650.0	650.2
a	650.2	650.4
lot	650.4	650.6
of	650.6	650.7
fun	650.7	651.1
but	651.1	651.1
it's	651.1	651.4
really	651.4	651.7
hard,	651.7	652.3
really	652.3	652.7
hard.	652.7	653.0
I	653.0	653.4
got	653.4	653.5
this	653.5	653.7
lousy	653.7	654.3
job.	654.3	654.5
I	654.5	655.0
barely	655.0	655.6
know	655.6	655.7
if	655.7	655.8
I'm	655.8	655.9
going	655.9	656.1
to	656.1	656.2
make	656.2	656.3
rent	656.3	656.7
and	656.7	656.9
forget	656.9	657.5
about	657.5	657.7
buying	657.7	658.2
stuff.	658.2	658.6
Oh,	658.6	659.0
honey,	659.0	659.9
you	659.9	660.4
don't	660.4	660.6
understand.	660.6	661.6
I'd	661.6	662.1
be	662.1	662.3
doing	662.3	662.8
what	662.8	663.0
you're	663.0	663.1
doing	663.1	663.3
but	663.3	664.2
with	664.2	664.4
money.	664.4	664.8
It's	666.8	667.3
very	667.3	667.8
different.	667.8	668.3
And	673.9	674.3
you	674.3	674.3
had	674.3	674.5
no	674.5	674.6
idea,	674.6	674.8
they	674.8	675.1
weren't	675.1	675.3
getting	675.3	675.5
along,	675.5	675.7
they	675.7	677.0
didn't	677.0	677.2
fight	677.2	677.5
a	677.5	677.6
lot.	677.6	677.8
I	681.8	682.0
know	682.0	682.4
they	682.4	682.5
were	682.5	682.7
having	682.7	682.8
problems.	682.8	682.9
You	685.5	685.8
know,	685.8	685.9
in	685.9	686.1
my	686.1	686.1
day	686.1	686.6
divorce	686.6	687.1
was	687.1	687.5
not	687.5	687.7
an	687.7	687.9
option.	687.9	688.4
Who's	690.7	691.1
up?	691.1	691.4
I	694.8	695.1
just	695.1	695.4
can't	695.4	695.6
believe	695.6	695.7
this	695.7	695.9
is	695.9	696.0
happening	696.0	696.2
to	696.2	697.3
me.	697.3	697.4
When	697.4	697.6
I	697.6	697.7
was	697.7	697.8
little,	697.8	698.1
everybody's	698.1	698.8
parents	698.8	699.0
were	699.0	699.2
getting	699.2	699.3
divorced,	699.3	699.5
you	699.5	700.1
know	700.1	700.2
what	700.2	700.3
is	700.3	700.5
figured	700.5	700.8
as	700.8	700.8
a	700.8	700.9
grown-up?	700.9	701.4
I	701.4	701.5
would	701.5	701.6
have	701.6	701.7
to	701.7	701.8
worry	701.8	702.1
about	702.1	702.2
those.	702.2	702.6
What	702.6	703.8
is	703.8	703.8
there	703.8	704.0
any	704.0	704.1
chance	704.1	704.4
that	704.4	704.4
you	704.4	704.5
can	704.5	704.7
look	704.7	704.8
at	704.8	704.9
this	704.9	705.0
is	705.0	705.2
flattering	705.2	705.7
when	705.7	706.5
she's	706.5	706.7
doing	706.7	706.9
it	706.9	707.0
because	707.0	707.0
she	707.0	707.3
wants	707.3	707.5
to	707.5	707.7
be	707.7	707.7
more	707.7	707.9
like	707.9	708.1
you.	708.1	708.2
Well	708.2	709.3
then	709.3	709.5
you	709.5	709.8
know,	709.8	709.9
couldn't	709.9	710.2
you	710.2	710.4
just	710.4	710.5
copy	710.5	710.9
my	710.9	711.0
haircut?	711.0	711.6
Notify	713.4	714.0
me	714.0	714.1
when	714.1	714.2
my	714.2	714.3
parents	714.3	714.6
got	714.6	714.7
divorced,	714.7	714.8
he	714.8	715.2
sent	715.2	715.4
me	715.4	715.5
the	715.5	715.6
shrink	715.6	716.2
and	716.2	716.4
she	716.4	716.6
told	716.6	716.8
me	716.8	716.9
that	716.9	717.0
all	717.0	717.2
kids	717.2	717.5
of	717.5	717.7
a	717.7	717.7
tendency	717.7	718.1
to	718.1	718.2
blame	718.2	718.4
themselves.	718.4	718.7
But	718.7	720.0
in	720.0	720.1
your	720.1	720.2
case,	720.2	720.3
