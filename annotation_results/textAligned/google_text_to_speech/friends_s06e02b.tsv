Hey.	415.4	415.7

thinking	418.9	419.2
that	419.2	419.2
maybe	419.2	419.3
we	419.3	419.5
should	419.5	419.8

it	498.1	498.2
was	498.2	498.4
significant	498.4	499.1
For	499.1	499.2
Me,	499.2	499.4
Maybe	499.4	499.9

possible.	615.8	615.9
Okay.	615.9	617.1
Would	617.1	617.4
I	617.4	617.5
do	617.5	617.6
that,	617.6	617.7
if	617.7	618.0
I	618.0	618.1
loved	618.1	618.7
her,	618.7	618.8
most	618.8	620.6

for	624.1	625.0
Rachel,	625.0	625.4
okay?	625.4	626.0
What's	629.9	630.8
wrong?	630.8	631.1
Chandler	634.0	634.5

in	635.3	635.4
here	635.4	635.7
and	635.7	635.9
I	635.9	636.0
have	636.0	636.3
to	636.3	636.5
move	636.5	636.6
out	636.6	636.8
and	636.8	637.1
everything	637.1	637.7

think	664.9	665.1
you	665.1	665.2

I	665.2	665.3
should	665.3	665.4

Filthy	681.5	681.9
Rich,	681.9	682.0
by	682.0	682.3
the	682.3	682.4
