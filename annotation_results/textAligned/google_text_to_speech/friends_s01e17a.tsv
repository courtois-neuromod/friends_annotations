football	72.9	73.2
with	73.2	73.6
my	73.6	73.6
kid.	73.6	74.1
I'm	78.6	81.8
on	81.8	81.9
this	81.9	82.0
field	82.0	82.3
and	82.3	82.9
they	82.9	83.0
they	83.0	83.5
hiked	83.5	83.8
me.	83.8	84.0
The	84.0	84.3
baby	84.3	84.6
I	84.6	86.7

I've	86.9	87.0
got	87.0	87.1
to	87.1	87.2
do	87.2	87.3
something	87.3	87.7
cuz	87.7	87.9
the	87.9	88.1
Tampa	88.1	88.4
Bay	88.4	88.6
defense	88.6	88.7
is	88.7	89.1

thing,	376.1	376.2
I	376.2	376.7

business	379.0	379.5
five	379.5	380.7
years	380.7	380.8

If	381.2	381.5

born	391.1	391.2
freak	391.2	392.8
out	392.8	393.0
at	393.0	393.1
all.	393.1	393.3
I'm	393.3	393.5
not	393.5	393.6
freaking	393.6	394.2
out.	394.2	394.3
I'm	394.3	394.5
just	394.5	394.7
saying	394.7	395.0
if	395.0	395.2
someone	395.2	395.6
had	395.6	396.1
come	396.1	396.2
to	396.2	396.5
me	396.5	396.6
with	396.6	396.8
the	396.8	396.9
idea	396.9	397.2
that	397.2	397.3
the	397.3	397.5

Panicky.	405.1	405.8
Oh	405.8	406.4
my	406.4	406.6
God	406.6	407.0
I'm	407.0	407.2
going	407.2	407.4
to	407.4	407.6
be	407.6	407.7
a	407.7	407.7
father	407.7	408.0
kind	408.0	408.4
of	408.4	408.5
a	408.5	408.6
thing.	408.6	409.0
We	412.1	412.4
just	412.4	412.6
had	412.6	412.8
kids	412.8	413.1
back	413.1	413.3
then	413.3	413.4
we	413.4	414.1
didn't	414.1	414.3
think	414.3	414.4
about	414.4	414.6
it.	414.6	414.9
What	416.2	416.6
else	416.6	416.8
could	416.8	416.9
the	416.9	417.1
sundry	417.1	417.6
I	417.6	417.8
wonder.	417.8	418.1
Come	419.7	420.5
on	420.5	420.8
kids,	420.8	421.3
right?	421.3	422.2
Look	422.2	422.5
your	422.5	423.8
mother	423.8	423.9
really	423.9	424.2
did	424.2	424.4
to	424.4	424.6
work.	424.6	424.8
I	424.8	425.1
was	425.1	425.3
busy	425.3	425.5
with	425.5	425.7
the	425.7	425.8
business.	425.8	425.9
I	425.9	426.8
wasn't	426.8	427.1
around	427.1	427.4
that	427.4	427.6
much.	427.6	427.8
Is	427.8	429.0
that	429.0	429.2
what	429.2	429.5
this	429.5	429.6
is	429.6	429.7
about?	429.7	429.8
Oh	431.2	431.4
no.	431.4	431.8
I	431.8	432.0
was	432.0	432.2
just	432.2	432.2
wondering	432.2	432.5
if	432.5	432.9
it's	432.9	433.0
time	433.0	433.2
to	433.2	433.3
make	433.3	433.5
up	433.5	433.7
for	433.7	433.9
that.	433.9	433.9
We	433.9	434.8
can	434.8	434.9
do	434.9	435.1
stuff	435.1	435.4
together.	435.4	435.6
You	435.6	436.9
always	436.9	437.2
wanted	437.2	437.5
to	437.5	437.6
go	437.6	437.7
to	437.7	437.8
that	437.8	437.9
Colonial	437.9	438.5
Williamsburg.	438.5	439.5
How	439.5	439.6
about	439.6	439.9
we	439.9	440.0
do	440.0	440.2
that?	440.2	440.3
You	440.3	443.9
know,	443.9	444.0
I	444.0	444.2
just	444.2	444.3
I	444.3	445.0
just	445.0	445.1
I	446.9	447.2
just	447.2	447.4
needed	447.4	447.7
to	447.7	447.8
know.	447.8	448.0
What	449.4	449.9
did	449.9	450.0
you	450.0	450.2
start	450.2	450.6
to	450.6	450.7
feel	450.7	450.9
like	450.9	451.2
a	451.2	451.3
bother?	451.3	451.8
oh,	452.7	453.0
well,	453.0	454.3
I	454.3	454.5
guess	454.5	454.7
it	454.7	455.8
must	455.8	456.2
have	456.2	456.3
been	456.3	456.5
The	457.5	457.9
day	457.9	458.1
after	458.1	458.3
you	458.3	458.5
were	458.5	458.6
born,	458.6	458.8
we	458.8	459.8
were	459.8	459.9
in	459.9	460.0
the	460.0	460.1
hospital	460.1	460.3
room.	460.3	460.9
Your	460.9	461.2
mother	461.2	461.4
was	461.4	461.5
asleep	461.5	461.9
and	461.9	463.1
they	463.1	463.2
brought	463.2	463.5
you	463.5	463.8
in	463.8	463.9
and	463.9	464.7
gave	464.7	465.0
you	465.0	465.2
to	465.2	465.3
me.	465.3	465.4
You	466.7	467.1
with	467.1	467.3
this	467.3	467.3
ugly	467.3	468.3
little	468.3	468.5
red	468.5	468.8
thing	468.8	469.2
and	469.2	470.6
all	470.6	470.8
of	470.8	470.9
a	470.9	471.0
sudden	471.0	471.0
you	471.0	471.5
wrapped	471.5	472.3
my	472.3	472.5
finger	472.5	472.9
with	472.9	473.0
your	473.0	473.1
whole	473.1	473.4
fist	473.4	473.6
and	473.6	475.1
you	475.1	475.2
squeezed.	475.2	475.8
So	475.8	477.0
tight,	477.0	477.2
That's	480.2	480.8
when	480.8	481.0
I	481.0	481.1
knew.	481.1	481.1
So,	485.4	485.9
you	485.9	486.0
don't	486.0	486.1
want	486.1	486.2
to	486.2	486.3
go	486.3	486.4
to	486.4	486.5
Williamsburg.	486.5	487.1
And	491.4	491.8
we	491.8	491.9
can	491.9	492.1
go	492.1	492.2
to	492.2	492.3
Williamsburg.	492.3	493.0
Eat	494.7	495.1
your	495.1	495.3
fish.	495.3	495.5
Hi	505.0	505.4
Jeffery.	505.4	507.5
This	507.5	507.7

the	510.9	511.0
cellars	511.0	511.5

Ernest	511.6	512.1
and	512.1	512.5
Tova	512.5	512.8
Borgnine.	512.8	513.2
So	513.2	513.7

resist	515.3	515.9
Monica	515.9	518.6
as	518.6	518.8
the	518.8	518.9
ankle.	518.9	519.2
Why	521.9	522.8
don't	522.8	523.0
you	523.0	523.1
tell	523.1	523.3
him	523.3	523.4

we	542.6	542.7
just	542.7	542.7

them	542.9	543.1
who	543.1	543.2
we	543.2	543.2
really	543.2	543.4
are?	543.4	543.6
I	543.6	544.2
mean,	544.2	544.4
it'll	544.4	544.6
be	544.6	544.7
fine.	544.7	545.0
I	545.0	545.1
really	545.1	545.2
think	545.2	545.5
it'll	545.5	545.6
be	545.6	545.7
fine.	545.7	545.9
Excuse	552.2	552.7
me	552.7	552.8
for	552.8	553.0
living	553.0	553.1
in	553.1	553.4
the	553.4	553.4
real	553.4	553.6
world	553.6	553.7
still	553.7	556.4
seem	556.4	556.7
normal.	556.7	556.8
Okay,	556.8	558.4
but	558.4	558.5
you	558.5	558.6

do	578.3	578.4
it.	578.4	578.6
Sometimes	578.6	579.3
you	579.3	579.3
can	579.3	579.5
be	579.5	579.5
