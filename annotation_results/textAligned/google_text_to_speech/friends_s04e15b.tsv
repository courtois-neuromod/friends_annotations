I	116.8	116.9
felt	116.9	117.4
his	117.4	117.7
pulse.	117.7	118.0
Electrical	120.4	125.0
plans	125.0	125.4
for	125.4	125.5
the	125.5	125.6
building.	125.6	125.7
Okay.	126.6	128.2
Okay.	128.2	128.5
Okay.	128.5	128.5
Should	128.5	129.1
I	129.1	129.1
be	129.1	129.3
scared?	129.3	129.4
I	131.0	131.3

that's	131.6	131.9
what	131.9	132.1
you're	132.1	132.1
going	132.1	132.3
to	132.3	132.4
do	132.4	132.5
something.	132.5	132.8
Okay,	132.8	133.0
so	133.0	133.3
what's	133.3	133.4
up?	133.4	133.5
I	133.5	133.5
went	133.5	133.6
down	133.6	133.8
to	133.8	133.9
City	133.9	134.1

I	134.3	134.5
got	134.5	134.6
these	134.6	134.8
I'll	134.8	135.4
have	135.4	135.6
to	135.6	135.7
do	135.7	135.8
is	135.8	136.0
pay	136.0	136.1
$25	136.1	136.8
and	136.8	136.9
wait	136.9	137.1
in	137.1	137.2
line	137.2	137.3
for	137.3	137.4
3	137.4	137.6
hours.	137.6	137.9
What,	139.2	139.5
how	139.5	139.7
people	139.7	141.3
knew?	141.3	141.4
All	145.6	146.0
right,	146.0	146.2
you	146.2	146.4
do	146.4	146.5
understand	146.5	147.7
and	147.7	147.8
I	147.8	147.9
do	147.9	149.2
know,	149.2	149.3
I	149.3	149.5
don't	149.5	149.5
understand	149.5	150.5
any	150.5	150.8
of	150.8	150.9
this	150.9	151.0
electrical	151.0	151.4
stuff.	151.4	151.9
I	155.3	155.6
don't	155.6	155.8
know,	155.8	155.9
I	155.9	157.2
don't	157.2	158.3
know.	158.3	158.4
It	158.4	159.4
looks	159.4	159.5
like	159.5	159.6
a	159.6	159.8
bunny	159.8	160.0
do	160.0	160.2
You	172.7	173.1
know,	173.1	173.2
you	173.2	173.3
really	173.3	174.5
didn't	174.5	174.8
have	174.8	174.8
to	174.8	175.0
take	175.0	175.1
you	175.1	175.3
to	175.3	175.3
the	175.3	175.5
airport.	175.5	175.5
Every	175.5	177.9
moment	177.9	178.5
is	178.5	178.6
precious	178.6	178.8
very	178.8	184.8
much	184.8	185.0
that	185.0	185.2
you're	185.2	185.3
leaving,	185.3	185.6
but	185.6	187.1
we're	187.1	187.4
not	187.4	187.5
really	187.5	187.6
that	187.6	187.8
close.	187.8	188.0
Okay,	190.8	191.3
so	191.3	191.7
I	191.7	191.8
guess	191.8	192.0
this	192.0	192.1
is	192.1	192.2
goodbye	192.2	193.6
then.	193.6	193.7

plane.	197.7	197.9
okay,	199.7	200.0
well	200.0	200.3
I	200.3	200.7
guess	200.7	200.8
just	200.8	201.1
wait	201.1	202.0
here	202.0	202.2
then	202.2	202.3
