People	43.3	44.2

That's	44.8	45.0

these	52.9	53.3
movies	53.3	54.2
are	54.2	54.9
offensive	54.9	55.5
and	55.5	56.8
degrading	56.8	57.8
to	57.8	58.0
women	58.0	58.1
and	58.1	59.3
females	59.3	60.2
and	60.2	61.9
and	61.9	63.0
the	63.0	63.1
lighting's	63.1	63.8

Okay,	98.5	98.9

The	102.9	103.0

I	169.2	170.0
don't,	170.0	170.2
I	170.2	170.3
don't	170.3	170.4
understand.	170.4	171.0
I	171.0	171.1
don't	171.1	171.3
understand,	171.3	171.8
how	171.8	172.3
can	172.3	172.4
you	172.4	172.6
be	172.6	172.7
straight?	172.7	173.1
And	173.1	173.6
you're	173.6	174.3
so	174.3	174.7
smart	174.7	175.2
and	175.2	175.6
funny,	175.6	176.0
and	176.0	176.2
you	176.2	176.4
throw	176.4	176.7
such	176.7	176.9
great	176.9	177.8
academy	177.8	178.0
award	178.0	178.6
party,	178.6	178.9
and	178.9	179.4
no	179.4	179.5
one	179.5	181.3
myself,	181.3	181.5
but	181.5	181.9
you	181.9	182.1
just	182.1	182.4
reach	182.4	182.6
a	182.6	182.6
point	182.6	182.9
where	182.9	183.0
you	183.0	183.2
can't	183.2	183.3
live	183.3	183.6
a	183.6	183.6
lie	183.6	183.8
anymore.	183.8	184.1
So,	186.4	186.7

long	187.1	187.2
have	187.2	187.5
you	187.5	187.6
known?	187.6	187.8
I	190.3	190.7
guess	190.7	191.0
on	191.0	191.1
some	191.1	191.3
level.	191.3	191.5
I	191.5	191.9
always	191.9	192.2
knew	192.2	192.4
it	192.4	192.5
was	192.5	192.7
straight,	192.7	193.5
but	193.5	193.8
I	193.8	195.1
thought	195.1	195.3
it	195.3	195.4
was	195.4	195.5
supposed	195.5	195.9
to	195.9	196.0
be.	196.0	196.2
And,	203.6	204.1
and	204.1	204.3
there's	204.3	206.1
actually	206.1	206.4
a	206.4	206.8
woman.	206.8	207.4
Her	208.9	209.3
name	209.3	209.5
is	209.5	209.6
Deborah.	209.6	210.0
Well,	213.3	213.9

I've	218.1	218.5
never	218.5	218.7
told	218.7	218.9

times	221.9	222.3
back	222.3	223.9
in	223.9	224.1
college.	224.1	224.6
When	224.6	225.9
I	225.9	226.1
get	226.1	226.3
really	226.3	226.5
drunk,	226.5	226.8

next	229.2	229.4

more	364.6	364.7
question	364.7	364.8
if	364.8	366.7

I	377.8	377.9
don't	377.9	377.9
think	377.9	378.1
either	378.1	378.6
answer	378.6	379.0
would	379.0	379.2
make	379.2	379.4
