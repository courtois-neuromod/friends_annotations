I	5.2	5.3
Kathy	5.3	5.6
make	5.6	5.8
it.	5.8	5.9
It	5.9	6.7
was	6.7	6.8
like	6.8	7.0
torture.	7.0	7.5
You	8.8	9.1

if	9.2	9.4

a	11.7	11.8
big	11.8	11.8
surprise.	11.8	12.2
He	12.2	14.0
just	14.0	14.3

getting	14.5	14.5
worse	14.5	14.9

weird	22.2	22.6
like	22.6	22.7

I	32.7	32.9
can	32.9	33.0
imagine	33.0	33.2
that	33.2	33.5
our	33.5	33.6
body	33.6	34.0
was	34.0	34.1
like	34.1	34.3
covered	34.3	34.8

boils	34.8	35.1

I	517.7	517.8
were	517.8	517.9
on	517.9	518.0
our	518.0	518.0
way	518.0	518.1
back	518.1	518.4
and	518.4	518.7
we	518.7	518.8
having	518.8	519.0
car	519.0	519.3
trouble	519.3	519.7
and	519.7	519.8
get	519.8	523.0
some	523.0	523.2
transmission	523.2	523.4
fluid.	523.4	523.7
You	523.7	525.2

soon	527.0	527.2
as	527.2	527.5
I	527.5	527.6

Why	528.0	528.2
can't	528.2	528.5
you	528.5	528.6
tell	528.6	528.8
her?	528.8	529.0
I	538.6	538.9
thought	538.9	539.2
your	539.2	539.3
time	539.3	539.6
ran	539.6	539.8
out,	539.8	539.9
but	539.9	541.0
I	541.0	541.0
guess	541.0	541.1
I	541.1	541.2
do	541.2	541.4
have	541.4	541.4
a	541.4	541.5

he's	548.1	548.2
sorry.	548.2	548.3
So	548.3	549.6

guess	549.8	550.0
it's	550.0	550.2
just	550.2	550.3
you	550.3	550.9
and	550.9	550.9
