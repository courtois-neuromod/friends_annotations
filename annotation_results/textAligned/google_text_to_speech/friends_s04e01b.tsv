everything	1.5	1.8
that	1.8	2.4
went	2.4	2.5
wrong	2.5	2.7
in	2.7	3.1
our	3.1	3.2
relationship.	3.2	3.3
I	3.3	4.6

how	7.0	7.2
I	7.2	7.4
was	7.4	7.6
unfaithful	7.6	7.9
to	7.9	8.3
her.	8.3	8.7
We	10.0	10.4

But	18.4	19.0
this	19.0	19.3
breakup	19.3	19.7
was	19.7	20.0
not	20.0	20.2
all	20.2	20.3
my	20.3	20.5

here,	21.6	22.3
if	22.3	22.7
you	22.7	22.9
accept	22.9	23.2
full	23.2	23.6
responsibility	23.6	23.7
for	23.7	24.9
responsibility,	24.9	26.2
I	26.2	26.3
can	26.3	26.6
begin	26.6	26.8
to	26.8	26.9
trust	26.9	27.2
you	27.2	27.5

something	29.1	29.5
you	29.5	29.7
can	29.7	30.0
do.	30.0	30.5
No	33.6	34.7

you're	39.4	39.7
back	39.7	39.8

you	40.8	41.0
bring	41.0	41.2
this	41.2	41.3
up.	41.3	41.4
Now	41.4	41.6
you're	41.6	41.8
going	41.8	42.0
to	42.0	42.0
wreck	42.0	42.3
the	42.3	42.4
best	42.4	42.8

I'll	49.2	49.4
let	49.4	49.5
it	49.5	49.6
go.	49.6	49.8
But	49.8	50.2
you,	50.2	50.5
you	50.5	50.7
understand	50.7	51.4
how	51.4	51.7
hard	51.7	52.3
it	52.3	52.3
is	52.3	52.4

Sure,	53.4	53.9
it's	53.9	54.2
hard	54.2	54.3
to	54.3	54.4
forget,	54.4	54.9
but	54.9	55.5
that	55.5	55.6
doesn't	55.6	55.8
mean	55.8	55.9
you	55.9	56.0
have	56.0	56.1

The	399.9	400.1

because	401.1	401.2
Well,	402.1	403.0
I	403.0	403.0
was	403.0	403.2
afraid	403.2	403.4
that	403.4	403.6
you	403.6	403.7
would	403.7	403.9
react	403.9	404.3

way	406.7	406.7
you're	406.7	407.0
reacting	407.0	407.1
right	407.1	407.6
now.	407.6	407.9
And	407.9	408.2
can't	408.2	408.8
wait	408.8	408.9

No.	413.6	413.9
Hey.	418.2	418.6
Sorry.	420.4	421.0
Just	424.1	424.7

You	426.5	426.9

we're	443.9	444.1
losing	444.1	444.5
anything.	444.5	444.7
Package.	447.3	448.0
Right.	448.0	448.3
It's	449.8	450.1

common	457.8	457.9
I	461.0	461.4
mean,	461.4	461.6
I	461.6	461.7

how	532.2	532.3
much	532.3	532.5
you've	532.5	532.8

credit,	542.2	544.2
my	544.2	544.4
mom	544.4	544.8
