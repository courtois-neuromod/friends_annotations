is	562.0	562.2
our	562.2	562.3
one	562.3	562.4
for	562.4	562.7
a	562.7	562.7
while.	562.7	562.9
Okay.	562.9	571.2
Go	571.2	572.2
restaurant.	572.2	572.7
Go	590.9	591.6
off	591.6	591.8
to	591.8	591.8
college.	591.8	591.9
Where	613.3	625.4
is	625.4	625.5
bird	625.5	625.7
in	625.7	625.8
the	625.8	625.9
sand	625.9	626.3
and	626.3	626.4
can't	626.4	626.7
find	626.7	626.9

just	653.2	653.2
a	653.2	653.4
moment	653.4	653.5
ago.	653.5	653.8
