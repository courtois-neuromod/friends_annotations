just	514.0	514.1
going	514.1	514.3
to	514.3	514.4
get	514.4	514.5
an	514.5	514.8
annulment.	514.8	515.2
Oh,	521.6	522.0
well,	522.0	522.6
that's	522.6	522.8
your	522.8	523.1
thing.	523.1	523.5
You	527.3	528.0
know,	528.0	528.2
that	528.2	528.4
you're	528.4	528.7
the	528.7	528.8
guy	528.8	529.1
who	529.1	529.4
gets	529.4	529.5
divorced.	529.5	529.8
So	542.2	542.5
much,	542.5	542.7
you're	542.7	542.9
probably	542.9	543.1
going	543.1	543.3
to	543.3	543.4
marry	543.4	543.7
it.	543.7	543.9
That	546.2	547.2
it	547.2	547.4
won't	547.4	547.5
work	547.5	547.6
out	547.6	547.8
so	547.8	548.1
you're	548.1	548.2
going	548.2	548.2
to	548.2	548.3
have	548.3	548.4
to	548.4	548.5
divorce	548.5	548.8
it.	548.8	549.0
Divorcing	549.0	549.5
guy.	549.5	549.7
You	561.1	561.4
want	561.4	561.6
to	561.6	561.6
go	561.6	561.7
out	561.7	561.8
play	561.8	562.1
some	562.1	562.2
pie,	562.2	562.4
gal.	562.4	562.7
but	565.0	565.4
I	565.4	565.5
kind	565.5	565.9
of	565.9	566.0
think	566.0	566.1
we	566.1	566.3
should	566.3	566.4
talk	566.4	567.0
about	567.0	567.1
last	567.1	567.4
night	567.4	567.5
and	567.5	571.2
I	571.2	571.5
don't	571.5	571.7
know	571.7	571.9
what	571.9	572.0
is	572.0	572.6
What	575.6	575.9
do	575.9	576.7
you	576.7	576.8
think	576.8	577.0
we	577.0	577.0
should	577.0	577.1
do?	577.1	577.3
If	577.3	577.4
I	577.4	577.5
don't	577.5	577.7
know,	577.7	577.7
I	577.7	579.1
love	579.1	579.4
you.	579.4	579.5
So	583.8	587.3
where	587.3	587.5
are	587.5	587.6
we	587.6	587.8
on	587.8	588.3
the	588.3	588.3
whole,	588.3	588.6
going	588.6	588.8
back	588.8	589.2
to	589.2	589.3
the	589.3	589.4
place	589.4	589.6
where	589.6	589.7
they	589.7	589.9
have	589.9	590.0
all	590.0	590.1
the	590.1	590.2
marriages	590.2	590.5
thing?	590.5	591.0
I	591.0	591.3
love	591.3	591.6
you.	591.6	591.8
Last	593.8	596.5
night,	596.5	596.7
I	596.7	598.1
love	598.1	600.3
you.	600.3	600.6
If	601.9	602.1
we	602.1	602.3
don't	602.3	602.4
get	602.4	602.5
married	602.5	602.8
unless	602.8	603.0
there's	603.0	603.4
a	603.4	603.4
sign.	603.4	604.0
Okay,	604.0	604.6
so	604.6	604.9
say	604.9	605.1
you	605.1	605.2
say	605.2	606.3
roll	606.3	606.6
another	606.6	606.7
eight,	606.7	607.0
then	607.0	607.4
there's	607.4	607.6
a	607.6	607.6
definite	607.6	608.1
sign	608.1	608.2
that	608.2	609.2
we	609.2	609.3
should	609.3	609.5
get	609.5	609.6
married	609.6	609.7
6	609.7	614.1
7,	614.1	614.4
9,	614.4	614.8
10,	614.8	614.9
11,	614.9	615.0
12.	615.0	615.3
Yes,	624.5	628.4
yes.	628.4	628.5
80	631.8	632.5
Z	632.5	632.6
8.	632.6	632.9
I	636.7	637.1
believe	637.1	637.3
I	637.3	637.4
actually	637.4	637.7
build	637.7	638.0
an	638.0	638.1
8:00	638.1	638.2
so	638.2	638.8
unlikely.	638.8	639.5
well,	641.8	642.2
if	642.2	642.4
you	642.4	642.5
married,	642.5	643.0
I	643.0	643.5
guess,	643.5	643.9
That's	648.2	648.6
right,	648.6	648.9
was	648.9	649.1
wrong.	649.1	649.2
Kind	649.2	649.6
of	649.6	649.7
ain't	649.7	650.0
no	650.0	650.1
wedding	650.1	650.6
dammit.	650.6	651.2
20.	657.4	657.9
What	661.7	662.1
do	662.1	662.1
I	662.1	662.3
look	662.3	662.4
like,	662.4	662.5
staying	662.5	662.9
right?	662.9	663.2
To	667.8	668.0
get	668.0	668.2
married,	668.2	668.4
there	668.4	668.6
would	668.6	668.7
be	668.7	668.8
a	668.8	668.9
clear-cut	668.9	669.5
sign.	669.5	670.3
Okay,	678.5	678.9
you	678.9	679.4
have	679.4	679.5
19	679.5	680.2
questions	680.2	680.4
left,	680.4	681.1
use	681.1	681.4
them	681.4	681.6
wisely.	681.6	681.9
