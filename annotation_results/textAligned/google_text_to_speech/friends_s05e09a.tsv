badass.	373.8	374.5
Bronte	385.7	386.4
sisters	386.4	386.6
were	386.6	387.1
really	387.1	387.6
remarkable	387.6	388.3
women	388.3	388.4
for	388.4	388.8
their	388.8	389.0
time	389.0	389.4
that	389.4	389.5
they	389.5	389.7
lived	389.7	389.9
in	389.9	390.0
a	390.0	390.1
patriarchal	390.1	390.5
society.	390.5	391.3
What's	398.2	398.6
the	398.6	398.8
book	398.8	398.9
about	398.9	399.0
things	399.0	400.2
that	400.2	400.3
you	400.3	400.4
read	400.4	400.7
it	400.7	400.7
in	400.7	400.8
high	400.8	401.0
school.	401.0	401.5
Yeah.	401.5	401.8
But	401.8	402.0
then	402.0	402.2
I	402.2	402.2
remembered	402.2	402.6
I	402.6	402.7
started	402.7	403.2
it	403.2	403.3
and	403.3	403.4
then	403.4	403.6
there	403.6	403.7
was	403.7	403.8
a	403.8	403.9
pep	403.9	404.2
rally	404.2	404.3
and	404.3	405.1
I	405.1	405.2
was	405.2	405.4
I	405.4	405.8
was	405.8	406.0
on	406.0	406.1
top	406.1	406.3
of	406.3	406.4
the	406.4	406.4
pyramid.	406.4	406.6
It's	410.3	411.5
a	411.5	411.6
tragic,	411.6	412.2
love	412.2	412.3
story	412.3	412.7
between	412.7	412.9
Cathy	412.9	413.5
and	413.5	413.7
Heathcliff	413.7	413.9
and	413.9	414.8
it	414.8	415.4
takes	415.4	415.6
place	415.6	415.8
on	415.8	416.2
these	416.2	416.4
look	416.4	416.5
really	416.5	416.6
creepy	416.6	417.0
more	417.0	417.5
than	417.5	417.7
England,	417.7	418.2
which	418.2	418.6
I	418.6	418.8
think	418.8	419.1
represent	419.1	419.6
the	419.6	419.7
wildness	419.7	420.2
of	420.2	420.2
heathcliff's	420.2	421.5
character.	421.5	422.1
I	422.1	422.7
totally	422.7	423.2
get	423.2	423.3
symbolism.	423.3	423.9
How	426.2	426.4
would	426.4	426.5
you	426.5	426.6
characterize	426.6	427.0
the	427.0	427.7
theme	427.7	427.9
of	427.9	428.0
this	428.0	428.2
book?	428.2	428.7
Well,	436.4	437.0
I	437.0	437.1
would	437.1	437.5
have	437.5	437.7
to	437.7	437.8
say	437.8	438.0
that	438.0	438.0
it's	438.0	438.3
a,	438.3	438.4
it's	438.4	438.7
a	438.7	438.8
tragic.	438.8	439.4
Love	439.4	439.6
story,	439.6	440.0
sort	440.0	442.3
of	442.3	442.4
a	442.4	442.5
given,	442.5	442.9
but	442.9	443.1
yes.	443.1	443.9
And	449.6	450.2
the	450.2	450.7
wildness	450.7	452.2
of	452.2	452.3
the	452.3	452.8
Moors	452.8	453.3
which	453.3	454.0
I	454.0	454.2
think	454.2	454.8
is	454.8	455.1
is	455.1	455.2
mirrored	455.2	456.0
in	456.0	456.5
the	456.5	456.7
wildness	456.7	457.2
of	457.2	457.3
heathcliff's	457.3	458.5
character.	458.5	459.0
Shrewdly	461.4	463.9
observed	463.9	464.5
here.	464.5	464.8
So	471.3	471.5
you	471.5	471.6
didn't	471.6	471.8
even	471.8	471.9
read	471.9	472.3
it.	472.3	472.4
So	474.4	474.8
what	474.8	475.0
do	475.0	475.1
you	475.1	475.1
think	475.1	475.6
you	475.6	477.2
and	477.2	477.4
the	477.4	477.6
blue	477.6	477.8
shirt?	477.8	478.0
I	480.7	480.9
think	480.9	481.3
