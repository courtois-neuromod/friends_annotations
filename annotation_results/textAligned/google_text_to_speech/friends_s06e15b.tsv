Okay,	0.5	4.8

It's	12.5	13.4
not	13.4	13.6
that	13.6	13.8
bad	13.8	14.0
though.	14.0	14.9
Most	14.9	15.1
people	15.1	15.2
would	15.2	15.5
be	15.5	15.6
excited	15.6	16.1
if	16.1	16.2
they	16.2	16.3
don't	16.3	16.5
have	16.5	16.6
to	16.6	16.7
work	16.7	16.9
for	16.9	17.1
a	17.1	17.1

attack	29.6	29.7
is	29.7	30.0
Nature's,	30.0	30.4
way	30.4	30.5
of	30.5	30.6
telling	30.6	30.7
you	30.7	31.0
to	31.0	31.1
slow	31.1	31.3
it	31.3	31.6

But	37.5	37.9
you're	37.9	38.1
not	38.1	38.1
going	38.1	38.3
to	38.3	38.4
die.	38.4	38.5
I	38.5	39.6
mean,	39.6	39.6

are	39.8	39.9
going	39.9	40.1

die,	40.4	40.6
but	40.6	41.4
you're	41.4	41.6
not	41.6	41.7
going	41.7	41.8
to	41.8	41.9
die	41.9	42.0
today.	42.0	42.3
I	43.9	44.2
wish	44.2	44.4
I	44.4	44.5
was	44.5	44.6
dead.	44.6	44.9
Maybe	48.2	48.8
you	48.8	48.8

consider	49.0	49.0
buying	49.0	49.5

Pokemon	49.7	50.4
Toys	50.4	50.5
R	50.5	50.6

She	94.7	95.0
