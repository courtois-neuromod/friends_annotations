rachel:
    name: "Rachel Green"
    description: >
        A fashion enthusiast and Monica Geller's best friend from childhood. 
        Rachel first moves in with Monica in season one after nearly marrying 
        Barry Farber. Rachel and Ross Geller are later involved in an 
        on-again, off-again relationship throughout the series. Rachel dates 
        other men during the series, such as Italian neighbor, Paolo, in 
        season one; Joshua Bergin, a client from Bloomingdale's, in season 
        four; Tag Jones, her assistant, in season seven; and Joey Tribbiani, 
        one of her close friends, in season ten. Rachel's first job is as a 
        waitress at the coffee house Central Perk, but she later becomes an 
        assistant buyer at Bloomingdale's in season three, and a buyer at 
        Ralph Lauren in season five. Rachel and Ross have a daughter named 
        Emma Geller-Green in "The One Where Rachel Has a Baby, Part Two" at 
        the end of season eight. In the final episode of the series, Ross and 
        Rachel confess their love for each other, and Rachel gives up a dream 
        fashion job at Louis Vuitton in Paris to be with him.

monica:
    name: "Monica Geller"
    description: >
        The "mother hen" of the group and a chef, known for her perfectionist, 
        bossy, competitive, and obsessive-compulsive nature.[3][4] Monica was 
        overweight as a child. She works as a chef in various restaurants 
        throughout the show. Monica's first serious relationship is with a 
        long-time family friend Richard Burke, who is 21 years her senior. The 
        two maintain a strong relationship for some time until Richard expresses 
        that he does not want to have children. Monica and Chandler Bing, one of 
        her best friends, later start a relationship after spending a night with 
        each other in London in the season four finale, leading to their marriage 
        in season seven and the adoption of twins Jack and Erica Bing at the end 
        of the series. A running gag in the show is Chandler's easy-going and 
        humorous nature conflicting with Monica's high-maintenance and compulsive 
        behavior.

phoebe:
    name: "Phoebe Buffay"
    description: >
        A masseuse, vegetarian and self-taught musician. As a child, Phoebe 
        lived in upstate New York with her mother Lily Buffay, until her mother 
        committed suicide and Phoebe took to the streets. She writes and sings 
        her own strange songs, accompanying herself on the guitar. She has an 
        identical twin named Ursula Buffay, who shares few of Phoebe's traits. 
        Phoebe has three serious relationships over the show's run: David, a 
        scientist, in season one, with whom she breaks up when he moves to 
        Minsk on a research grant; Gary, a police officer whose badge she finds, 
        in season five; and an on-and-off relationship with Mike Hannigan in 
        seasons nine and ten. In season nine, Phoebe and Mike break up due to 
        his desire not to marry. David returns from Minsk, leading to the two 
        getting back together, but she eventually rejects him for Mike when both 
        of them propose to her. Phoebe and Mike marry in season ten.

joey:
    name: "Joey Tribbiani"
    description: >
        A struggling actor and food lover who becomes famous for his role on 
        soap opera Days of Our Lives as Dr. Drake Ramoray. Joey has many 
        short-term girlfriends. Despite his womanizing, Joey is innocent, caring, 
        and well-intentioned.[7] Joey often uses the catchphrase pick-up line 
        "How you doin'?" in his attempts to win over most of the women he meets. 
        Joey rooms with his best friend Chandler for years, and later with Rachel. 
        He falls in love with Rachel in season eight, but Rachel politely tells 
        Joey that she does not share his feelings. They eventually date briefly 
        in season ten, but after realizing it will not work due to their friendship 
        and Rachel's complicated relationship with Ross, they return to being 
        friends. At the end of the series, he is the only remaining single member 
        of the group, and becomes the main protagonist of the sequel series Joey.

chandler:
    name: "Chandler Bing"
    description: >
        An executive in statistical analysis and data reconfiguration for a 
        large multinational corporation. Chandler hates this job, although it 
        pays well. He attempts to quit during season one but is lured back with 
        a new office and a pay raise. He eventually quits this job in season nine 
        due to a transfer to Tulsa, Oklahoma. He becomes a junior copywriter at 
        an advertising agency later that season. Chandler has a peculiar family 
        history, being the son of an erotic novelist mother Nora Tyler Bing and 
        a gay, cross-dressing Las Vegas star father Charles Bing. Chandler is known 
        for his sarcastic sense of humor, bad luck in relationships, and tendency 
        to be the butt of all jokes.[8] Despite this, he is still kind and usually 
        serves as the voice of reason in contrast to his more arrogant and selfish 
        friends. Chandler marries Monica, one of his best friends, in season seven, 
        and they adopt twins at the end of the series. Before his relationship with 
        Monica, Chandler dated Janice Hosenstein in season one and subsequently 
        broke up with her many times.

ross:
    name: "Ross Geller"
    description: >
        Monica's "geeky" older brother, a PhD-carrying palaeontologist working at 
        the American Museum of Natural History, and later a tenured professor of 
        palaeontology at New York University. Ross is involved in an on-again, 
        off-again relationship with Rachel throughout the series. He has three 
        failed marriages during the series: Carol Willick, a lesbian who is also 
        the mother of his son, Ben Geller; Emily Waltham, who divorces him after 
        he accidentally says Rachel's name instead of hers during their wedding 
        vows; and Rachel, as the two drunkenly marry in Las Vegas. His divorces 
        become a running joke within the series. Following a one-night stand, he 
        and Rachel have a daughter, Emma, by the end of season eight. They finally 
        confess that they are still in love with each other in the series finale.
