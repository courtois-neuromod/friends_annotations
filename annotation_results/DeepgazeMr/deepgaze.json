      "Content": "Each .tsv contains three columns: the h and w coordinates (in pixels) of the peak saliency
      from the saliency map outputed by Deepgaze MR, and the number of local maxima within 20 pixels of one another
      (value >80% of maximal saliency value)"

    "Normalized Local Maxima": {
      "Format": "one *_locmax_normalized_xy.npz file per .mkv file, one list of local maxima per movie frame saved
      as an array of lists called 'deepgaze_vals'",
      "Content": "Each list contains three values for each local maximum identified within 20 pixels of one another
      whose value >80% of the maximal saliency value. Those three values are the local maximum's saliency (normalized within frame),
      and its normalized cartesian coordinates x and y. Those coordinates indicate a position on the screen
      where the movie was played. E.g., (x, y = (0, 0) is the screen's bottom left corner, while (x, y = (1, 1)
      is the screen's top right corner. These normalized positions can be compared directly with the normalized gaze
      positions estimated with our eyetracker. Of note, the movie occupied the screen's full width, and it was
      centered along the screen's height with padding above and below to respect the ratio specified in the task's session file
      (4/3.0 for Friends: https://github.com/courtois-neuromod/task_stimuli/tree/main/src/sessions)."

      whose value >80% of the maximal saliency value. Those three values are the local maximum's normalized saliency,
      and its coordinates in pixel space (h and w) that reflect its position in the movie frame. Note that
      (h, w = (0, 0) corresponds the top right corner of the image (matrix indexing)."
