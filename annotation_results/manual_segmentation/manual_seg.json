  "name": "Manual segmentation annotations",
  "columns": {
    "episode": "half episode number, shown over one run of fMRI data. E.g., s4e07b is the second (b) half of season 4, episode 7.",
    "scene": "scene number. A scene is a section of an episode that takes places in one location in continuous time. A scene includes a series of shots, each of which is a set of contiguous frames shot from individual cameras from varying angles. Of note, a scene can contain more than one story segment during which different characters address different issues. For example, an extended scene of the characters hanging out at Monica's apartment includes a segment during which Monica frets over her parents visiting, another during which Rachel looks for her lost engagement ring, and another during which Ross announces to his friends that his ex wife is pregnant.",
    "segment": "Segment number. A segment is a cohesive unit of story within an episode. Segments are delineated by boundaries that may reflect location changes, time jumps, character entries and departures, changes in character goals / focus of interest, musical transitions between scenes, the begining or end of theme song, or the half episode ending. The type of boundaries that frames the onset and offset of a segment are labelled as ONbond and OFFbond, respectively.",
    "onset": "segment onset time in seconds, from the begining of the half episode.",
    "offset": "segment offset time in seconds.",
    "duration": "segment duration in seconds",
    "descriptor": "need to remove from final dataset...",
    "caption_eng": "caption that summarizes the events that take place in a segment, in English. Captions were originally written in the main rater's native French and translated into English using deepl (https://www.deepl.com/translator) followed by some manual review to resolve ambiguities.",
    "caption_fr": "caption that summarizes the segment, in French. Captions were written by the main rater in her native French.",
    "ONbond_location": "boundary at the segment onset that reflects a change in location. E.g., the story cuts from appartment 1 to the coffee shop.",
    "ONbond_charact_entry": "onset boundary that reflects a character entry. E.g., everybody looks at Rachel as she walks into the coffee shop in a wedding dress.",
    "ONbond_charact_leave": "onset boundary that reflects a character departure. E.g., after their friends leave for the night, Rachel and Ross share a moment at the coffee shop.",
    "ONbond_time_jump": "onset boundary that reflects a jump in time (forward or backward, e.g., flashback). E.g., time jumps are used throughout the sphaghetti dinner shared by Monica, Ross and their parents.",
    "ONbond_goal_change": "onset boundary that reflects a change in the characters' main focus of interest, topic of conversation, etc. E.g., at the coffee shop, Phoebe explains how she found a thumb in a soda can, then the group moves on to discuss each other's flaws.",
    "ONbond_music_transit": "onset of a musical transition scene. Between main scenes, Friends includes a few very short scenes (3-4s) that feature outdoor footage of New York city (e.g., views from outside the apartment building) accompanied by music. Those snipets are given their own scene and segment number.",
    "ONbond_theme_song": "onset of the Friends theme song. Of note, for seasons 1-4, the theme song was edited out of the half episodes shown in the scanner to CNeuromod participants. For s1-4, 'theme song' scenes (1 segment) correspond to a few seconds of black screen. Half episodes from seasons 5 and 6 include the full theme song, which is given its own scene/segment number.",
    "OFFbond_location": "boundary at the segment offset that reflects a change in location.",
    "OFFbond_charact_entry": "offset boundary that reflects a character entry.",
    "OFFbond_charact_leave": "offset boundary that reflects a character departure.",
    "OFFbond_time_jump": "offset boundary that reflects a jump in time (forward or backward, e.g., flashback).",
    "OFFbond_goal_change": "offset boundary that reflects a change in the characters' main focus of interest, topic of conversation, etc.",
    "OFFbond_music_transit": "offset of a musical transition scene.",
    "OFFbond_theme_song": "onset of the Friends theme song, or series of black frames where the theme song was edited out of the half episode (seasons 1-4)",
    "OFFbond_end": "offset boundary that corresponds to the end of the half episode.",
    "loc_apt1_Mon_Rach": "boolean indicating whether the segment took place in Rachel and Monica's purple appartment (appartment 1).",
    "loc_apt2_Chan_Joey": "boolean indicating whether the segment took place in Chandler and Joey's beige appartment (appartment 2).",
    "loc_apt3_Ross": "boolean indicating whether the segment took place in Ross's appartment (appartment 3), flagged in season 6 only.",
    "loc_apt4_Pheob_Rach": "boolean indicating whether the segment took place in Phoebe and Rachel's appartment (appartment 4), flagged in season 6 only.",
    "loc_coffeeshop": "boolean indicating whether the segment took place in the Central Perk coffee shop.",
    "loc_outside": "boolean indicating whether the segment took place outside rather than indoors.",
    "loc_outside": "boolean indicating whether the segment took in an indoors location other than the appartments or coffee shop."
