This code is used to run Google speech to text, an API that takes audio files and generates from them words and  their timestamps. 
To use said code, a credential file is used because Google charges for the use of this API. It is simple to generate a credential file via their interface "Google Console".
Another thing to note is that to run large audio files, they need to be uploaded on Google cloud storage, also acessible via "Google Console".
