What the hell is that?!! What the hell is that? Is that you? Ohhhhhhh!

Boy, you are really not a morning person.

BACK OFF!!! Get up! Get up! Get up! God damn it! Get up, get up, get up, get up, get up!!

What is that noise?

You!

It's the chick! She's...going through some changes.

What kind of changes?

Well the vet seems to think that's she's becoming a rooster. We're getting a second opinion.

It looks like your uterus is ready for implantation.

Oh! I knew it! I knew it! I felt really thick this morning.

Well, okay, so what's now-go get, go get the eggs, put 'em in there.

Okay, it'll take just a little while to prepare the embryos.

Embryossss? As in, "More than one?"

Um-hmm, five actually.

Five? Okay, where am I giving birth, a hospital or a big box under the stairs?

We do five because that gives you a 25% chance that at least one will attach.

That's it! 25 percent? That means that's it's like 75 percent chance of no baby at all!

Hey, y'know I was thinking, what are the odds like if-if, if you stuff like 200 of them in there?

Sweety, now, she's a woman, not a gumball machine.

Okay, well y'know what, don't worry you guys, 'cause I'm-I'm gonna do this as many times as it takes to get it right.

Well, you see, the-the thing is, we-we only got, we kinda have one shot to make it right.

Umm, it costs $16,000 each time you do this. So, umm, we're kinda using all the money we have to do it just this one time.

Whoa!! That-okay, that's a lot of pressure on me and my uterus. So, well okay, so is there-is maybe is there something that I can do y'know just to like help make sure I get pregnant?

No, I'm sorry.

Wow! You guys really don't know anything!

I know! Why don't you get drunk! That worked for a lot of girls in my high school.

I can't find garbage bags!

Oh, I think I saw some in here.

What is it?!

I don't know! But maybe if we keep that drawer shut, it'll die.

I can't believe we're living here!
