Aunt Syl, stop yelling! All I'm saying is that if you had told me vegetarian lasagna, I would have made vegetarian lasagna. Well, the meat's only every third layer, maybe you could scrape.

Ross, did you really read all these baby books?

Yup! You could plunk me down in the middle of any woman's uterus, no compass, and I can find my way out of there like that!

Ooh, this is cool...it says in some parts of the world, people actually eat the placenta.

And, we're done with the yogurt.

Sorry.

Aunt Syl, I did this as a favor, I am not a caterer. What do you want me to do with a dozen lasagnas? Nice talk, Aunt Syl. You kiss Uncle Freddie with that mouth?

Hey Ross, listen, you know that right now, your baby's only this big? This is your baby. Hi Daddy!

Hello!

How come you don't live with Mommy? How come Mommy lives with that other lady? What's a lesbian?

Honey, you can say it, Poconos, Poconos, it's like Poc-o-nos

Ah, poke a nose, mmm

Mma, Mma, Mmaah

So, did I hear Poconos?

Yes, my sister's giving us her place for the weekend.

Woo-hoo, first weekend away together!

Yeah, that's a big step.

I know...

Ah, it's just a weekend, big deal!

Wasn't this supposed to be just a fling, huh? Shouldn't it be... flung by now?

I mean, we are way past the fling thing, I mean, I am feeling things that I've only read about in Danielle Steele books, you know? I mean, when I'm with him, I'm totally, totally...

...nauseous, I'm physically nauseous. What am I supposed to do, huh? Call immigration? I could call immigration!

Ok, so it's just because it was my table, I have to buy a new one?

That's the rule.

What rule? There's no rule, if anything, you owe me a table!

How'd you get to that?

Well, I believe the piece of furniture was fine until your little breakfast adventure with Angela Delvecchio

You knew about that?

Well, let's just say the impressions you made in the butter left little to the imagination.

Ok, ok, How about if we split it?

What do you mean, like, buy it together?

Yeah

You think we're ready for something like that?

Why not?

Well, it's a pretty big commitment, I mean, what if one of us wants to move out?

Why, are you moving out?

I'm not moving out.

You'd tell me if you were moving out right

Yeah, yeah, it's just that with my last roommate Kip...

Aw, I know all about Kip!

It's just that we bought a hibachi together, and then he ran off and got married, and things got pretty ugly.

Well, let me ask you something, was Kip a better roommate than me?

Aw, don't do that

We've got a couple changes in your schedule. Your 4:00 herbal massage has been pushed back to 4:30 and Miss Somerfield canceled her 5:30 shiatsu.

Ok, thanks.

Oh, here comes your 3:00. I don't mean to sound unprofessional, but, yum

Buon Giorno, Bella Phoebe!

Oh, Paolo, hi, what are you doing here?

Uh, Racquela tell me you massage, eh?

Well, Racquela's right, yeah!

Oh, okay, I don't know what you just said, so let's get started.

Uh, I am, uh, being naked?

Um, that's really your decision, I mean, some people prefer, you know, to take off...oh whoops! You're being naked!

I can't believe you don't want to know. I mean, I couldn't not know, I mean, if, if the doctor knows, and Carol knows, and Susan knows....

And Monica knows...

Wha, heh, how could you know, I don't even know!

Carol called me to thank me for the lasagna, I asked, she told me.

So what's it gonna be?

Waitohheyhuh, oh great now he knows, and I don't know!

I'm sorry, I'm just excited about being an aunt!

Or an uncle...

Hey Phoebe!

Hi Pheebs!

Pheebs!

Fine!

Phoebe, what's the matter?

Nothing, I'm sorry, I'm just, I'm out of sorts.

Hey, can we get some cappuccino over here?

Oh, right, that's me!

Hey, Chandler, that table place closes at 7, come on.

Fine.

Phoebe, what is it?

All right, you know Paolo?

I'm familiar with his work, yes...

Well, he made a move on me.

Whoa, store will be open tomorrow!

More coffee over here, please!

Well, what happened?

Well, he came in for a massage, and everything was fine until.

Ooooohh!

My God.

Are you sure?

Oh yeah, I'm sure. And all of a sudden his hands weren't the problem anymore.

Was it...?

Oh, boy scouts could have camped under there.

Oooooo....

"Ooo," what?

Uma Thurman.

Oh!

The actress!

Thanks Rach.

So what are you gonna do?

You have to tell her! You have to tell her! It's your moral obligation, as a friend, as a woman, I think it's a feminist issue! Guys? Guys?

Oh, yeah, you have to tell her.

Feminist issue. That's where I went!

She is gonna hate me.

Yeah, well...

Will you pick one, just pick one! Here, how about that one?

That's patio furniture!

So what, like people are gonna come in and think, "Uh-oh, I'm outside again?" Of course!

What about the birds?

I don't know, birds just don't say, "Hello, sit here, eat something."

You pick one.

All right, how about the ladybugs?

Oh, so, forget about the birds, but big red insects suggest fine dining!

Fine, you want to get the birds, get the birds!

Not like that, I won't! Kip would have liked the birds!

Hey!

Hi Pheebs!

Are you moving out?

No, these aren't all my suitcases. This one's Paolo's.

Um, um, Rachel can we talk for a sec?

Well, sure...just a sec, though, 'cause Paolo's on his way over.

Oh! Ok, um, ok, um,

Oh, Pheebs, Pheebs...

Ok, um, we haven't known each other for that long a time, and, um, there are three things that you should know about me. One, my friends are the most important thing in my life, two, I never lie, and three, I make the best oatmeal raisin cookies in the world.

Ok, thanks Pheebs Oh my God, why have I never tasted these before?!

Oh, I don't make them a lot because I don't think it's fair to the other cookies

All right, well, you're right, these are the best oatmeal cookies I've ever had.

Which proves that I never lie.

I guess you don't.

Paolo made a pass at me.

So, what do you think?

I think It's the most beautiful table I've ever seen.

I know!

So how does this work, you going to balance the plates on these little guys' heads?

Who cares, we'll eat at the sink! Come on, let's play!

Heads up Ross! Score! You suck!

Are you okay?

I need some milk.

Ok, I've got milk Here you go... Oh! Better?

No...oh, I feel so stupid! Oh, I think about the other day with you guys and I was all "Oh, Paolo, he's so great, he makes me feel so..." Oh, God, I'm so embarrassed!

I'm so embarrassed, I'm the one he hit on!

Pheebs, if I had never met him this never would have happened!

I'm so sorry! No I'm sorry! No I'm sorry! No I'm sorry!

No, wait, oh, what are we sorry about?

I don't know...right, he's the pig!

Such a pig!

Oh, God, he's such a pig,

Oh he's like a...

He's like a big disgusting...

...like a...

...pig...pig man!

Yes, good! Ok...

Oh, but he was my pig man...how did I not see this?

Oh! I know! It's because... he's gorgeous, and he's charming, and when he looks at you...

Ok, Ok, Pheebs...

The end.

Oh, God...

Should I not have told you?

No, no, trust, me, it's, it's, it's much better that I know. Uh, I just liked it better before it was better...

I think she took it pretty well. You know Paolo's over there right now, so...

We should get over there and see if she's okay. Just one...second! Score! Game! Come on.

Ah...ooh! Well, looks like, uh, we kicked your butts.

No-no, she kicked our butts. You could be on the Olympic standing-there team.

Come on, two on one.

What are you still doing here? She just broke up with the guy, it's time for you to swoop in!

What, now?

Yes, now is when you swoop! You gotta make sure that when Paolo walks out of there, the first guy Rachel sees is you, She's gotta know that you're everything he's not! You're like, like the anti-Paolo!

My Catholic friend is right. She's distraught. You're there for her. You pick up the pieces, and then you usher in the age of Ross!

Yes! And that would be a shut-down!

Shut-out!!

Where are you guys going? Come on, one more game!

Uh, it's 2:30 in the morning!

Yeah, get out!

You guys are always hanging out in my apartment! Come on, I'll only use my left hand, huh? Come on, wussies! All right, ok, I gotta go. I'm going, and I'm gone.

One more game?

Oh yeah!
