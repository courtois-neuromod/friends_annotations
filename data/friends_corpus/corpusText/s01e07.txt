Wow, this is so cool, you guys. The entire city is blacked out!

Mom says it's all of Manhattan, parts of Brooklyn and Queens, and they have no idea when it's coming back on.

Wow, you guys, this is big.

Pants and a sweater? Why, mom? Who am I gonna meet in a blackout? Power company guys? Eligible looters? Could we talk about this later? OK.

Can I borrow the phone? I want to call my apartment and check on my grandma. What's my number?

Well, I never call me.

Oh my God, it's that Victoria's Secret model. Something... something Goodacre.

Hi Mom, it's Jill.

She's right, it's Jill. Jill Goodacre. Oh my God. I am trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre! Is it a vestibule? Maybe it's an atrium. Oh, yeah, that is the part to focus on, you idiot!

Yeah, I'm fine. I'm just stuck at the bank, in an ATM vestibule.

Jill says vestibule... I'm going with vestibule.

I'm fine. No, I'm not alone... I don't know, some guy.

Oh! Some guy. Some guy. 'Hey Jill, I saw you with some guy last night. Yes, he was some guy.

Hi everyone.

And officiating at tonight's blackout, is Rabbi Tribbiani.

Well, Chandler's old roomate was Jewish, and these are the only candles we have, so... Happy Chanukah, everyone.

Eww, look. Ugly Naked Guy lit a bunch of candles.

That had to hurt!

Alright, alright, alright. It's been fourteen and a half minutes and you still have not said one word. Oh God, do something. Just make contact, smile!

There you go!

You're definitely scaring here.

Would you like to call somebody?

Yeah, about 300 guys I went to high school with. Yeah, thanks.

Hello?

Hey, it's me.

It's Chandler! Are you OK?

Yeah, I'm fine. I'm trppd in an ATM vstbl wth Jll Gdcr.

What?

I'm trppd... in an ATM vstbl... wth Jll Gdcr!

I have no idea what you just said.

Put Joey on the phone.

What's up man?

I'm trppd... in an ATM vstbl... wth JLL GDCR.

Oh my God! He's trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre! Chandler, listen.

Yeah, like that thought never entered my mind.

Hmmm... this is so nice.

OK, I have a question. Well, actually, it's not so much a question as.. more of a general wondering... ment.

OK.

OK. Here goes. For a while now, I've been wanting to, um....

Ohhh!!!!

Yes, yes, that's right...

Oh, look at the little cat!

What? Ow!

I'm on top of the world, looking down on creation and the only explanation I can find, is the wonders I've found ever since...

This is just Bactine. It won't hurt.

Sorry, that was wax.

Oh, poor little Tooty is scared to death. We should find his owner.

Why don't we just put 'poor little Tooty' out in the hall?

During a blackout? He'd get trampled!

Yeah?

Oh no, the Mendels, they hate all living things, right?

Oh. Hi. We just found this cat and we're looking for the owner.

Er, yeah, it's mine.

He seems to hate you. Are you sure?

Yeah, it's my cat. Give me my cat.

Wait a minute. What's his name?

Ehhhh... B-Buttons.

Bob Buttons?

Mmm. Bob Buttons. Here, Bob Buttons.

Oooh! You are a very bad man!

You owe me a cat.

Lucky sixes....

Everybody, this is Paolo. Paolo, I want you to meet my friends. This is Monica.

Hi!

And Joey....

Hi!

And Ross.

Hi!

He doesn't speak much English.

Monopoly!

Look at that!

So, um... where did Paolo come from?

Oh... Italy, I think.

No, I mean tonight, in the building. Suddenly. Into our lives.

Well, the cat... the cat turned out to be Paolo's cat!

That, that is funny... .... and Rachel keeps touching him.

Alright. I looked all over the building and I couldn't find the kitty anywhere.

Oh, I found him. He was Paolo's cat.

Ah! Well! There you go! Last to know again! And I'm guessing... since nobody told me... this is Paolo.

Ah, Paolo, this is Phoebe.

You betcha!

Ah, let's see. What next? Blow a bubble. A bubble's good. It's got a... boyish charm, it's impish. Here we go.

Nice going, imp. OK, it's OK. All I need to do is reach over and put it in my mouth.

Good save! We're back on track, and I'm... ..chewing someone else's gum. This is not my gum. Oh my God! Oh my God! And now you're choking.

Are you alright?

My God, you're choking! That better?

Yes... thank you. That was... that was....

Perfection?

Oh, look look look. The last candle's about to burn out. 10, 9, 8, 7... ... negative 46, negative 47, negative 48....

Thank you.

Thanks.

Kinda... spooky without any lights.

Bwah-hah-hah!

OK, guys, guys? I have the definitive one. Mwwwooooo-hah-hah...

Oh.. oh... oh.

Hey Ross. This probably isn't the best time to bring it up, but you have to throw a party for Monica.
