Hello.

Hey, it's me. I know you can't stand to be in the same room as me, so I just thought I'd try and apologize over the phone. All I...

Hello.

Look I never should have kissed your girlfriend, but I'm...

Stop callin'!!

Hey! Hey! Hey! This is 92.3, WXRK, K-Rock for our $1,000 daily challenge.

All right!

What is the name of your roommate who is very, very sorry and would do anything...

Hey!

Hey!

What are you doing?

I'm sending back all this stuff that Chandler bought out of guilt.

Everything? Even the TV?

No! I'm putting that in my room.

Listen, Joey, I know what he did was wrong but don't you think you could at least hear the guy out?

Back when you and Rachel were together, if Chandler had kissed her, would you hear him out?

That's a good point. So uh, how long are you gonna punish him?

Five years.

You've sentenced him?!

Hey! Don't do the crime if you can't do the time.

Joey, the guy's your best friend.

No, was my best friend. Anyway, I don't know why you're pushing for him so hard. With him out of the way as my best friend, there's a spot open.

Oh, who? Me?

Yeah!

Wow! I'm honored! And y'know what I'm gonna do as my first act as your best friend?

What?

I'm gonna get you to talk to Chandler.

All right. But if you weren't my best friend.

Oh my God, is it really that bad?

I walk into a room and he won't even talk to me, he just mumbles something in Italian. And I know he only knows the bad words.

Hey Gunther, have you uh, have you seen Chandler?

I thought you were Chandler. But umm, one of who is over there.

Oh.

Hey Joe.

I'll be right with you. Okay? Thanks, Wendy.

Oh my God! How cute is the on-call doctor?

Ooh, so cute, that I'm thinking about jamming this pen in my eye.

Dr. Burke will see you know.

Oh no-no-no, not Dr. Burke. Dr. Burke is out of town. The-the on-call doctor will see me now.

Dr. Richard Burke is out of town. Dr. Timothy Burke, his son, will see you now.

Ready?

Hey! I'm sorry! That- where are you going?

My folks.

Oh, uh, when-when are you coming back?

I don't know. I might stay there for a few days while I look for an apartment.

What?!

Yeah, y'know at first I thought we could talk about this y'know, work it out, but uh, seeing you two together I don't think I...

Hey, look, what do you want me to say? Do you want me to say that I'll stop seeing her?

Look, it's not about her. Okay? But seeing you two together just reminds me of what you did. And I don't want to live with some one who doesn't know what it is to be a friend. So, I'll see ya.

Hey, look, I know what it is to be a friend, I just-I just screwed up!

Yeah! You did! And that's why I'm leaving.

All right look, if you're not gonna stay for me, then at least stay for them! Okay, they have had a very difficult year! What with the robbery and all!

When that guy was robbing us, and I was locked in the entertainment unit for like six hours, you know what I was doing in there all that time? I was thinking about how I let you down!

What?

Yeah! But if would've know what kind of friend you were gonna turn out to be, I wouldn't have worried about it so much! See you around!

All right, wait! Come on! Just wait one second! There has to be something that I can do! Something! If we still had that entertainment unit I would get in it for six hours and think about how I let you down. What?

We've got a box.

Last time I saw you, it was the morning I left for college. And you were just standing outside The Dairy Queen.

I was probably waiting for it to open.

I gotta tell you, you look great now.

You look great too.

You're an excellent patient!

So how does it look?

Well, you've got a little scratch on your cornea, your gonna have to wear a patch for a couple of days.

Like a pirate?!

If that helps you.

Umm, so how long have you been working with your dad? Come on, one of us had to mention him.

I moved back here a couple of months ago.

Oh. Big family dinner tonight?

Uh.

No way!

I was gonna have Thanksgiving at my girlfriend's.

Oh.

But we broke up.

Oh.

She-she wasn't ready for a serious commitment.

Oh. So you made her walk the plank? Aye, matie?

You're not wearing the patch yet.

I know.

Oh, he sees her!

Oh, he's catching up to her!

Oh, she sees him! Oh, they're hugging!

He's taking her purse!

Uhh, that's not them. I'm gonna go call the police.

Oh, there they are!

All right, get a room.
