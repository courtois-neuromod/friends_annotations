Hi.

Six dollars, please.

Six? I just had it for one night. It's three.

Eight o'clock is the cut-off and, aww, it's 8:02.

Y'know in a weird way, you have too much power. Look, you're gonna have to help me out here, 'cause I only have three.

I can help with that.

Oh my God. Richard? Hi!

Hi!

Wow! Your lip went bald. Hey, thanks.

So, you look great.

Right.

No you do. You... just...

What?

You've got panties stuck to your leg.

That's because I-I was just grabbing some things out of the dryer, and it's static cling. Or maybe it's just that God knew I'd be running into you and saw an opportunity.

It's good to see you.

It's good to see you too.

You see that guy? He's in classics now, but y'know as soon as we leave he's going straight to the porn.

He's gonna go up to the counter with Citizen Kane, Vertigo, and Clockwork Orgy. This is nice.

Yeah.

I missed this.

Me too.

So, you wanna get a hamburger or something?

Oh, um, I don't know if that's a good idea.

Oh. Look, just friends, I won't grope you. I promise.

No, I just I think that it's too soon.

No it's not too soon, I had lunch at a eleven.

Hey.

Hey.

Do you have any ice?

Check the freezer. If there's none in there, then we're probably out. Are you just getting in from work? It's late.

Yeah, I know. I had the greatest day though, I got to sit in on the meeting with the reps from Calvin Klien. I told my boss I liked this line of lingerie, she ordered a ton of it. How was your day?

I discovered I'm able to count all of my teeth using just my tongue.

Hmm. Umm, why do you have a copy of The Shining in your freezer?

Oh, I was reading it last night, and I got scared, so.

But ah, you're safe from it if it's in the freezer?

Well, safer. Y'know, I mean I never start reading The Shining, without making sure we've got plenty of room in the freezer, y'know.

How often do you read it?

Haven't you ever read the same book over and over again?

Well, umm, I guess I read Little Women more than once. But I mean that's a classic, what's so great about The Shining?

The question should be Rach, what is not so great about the shining. Okay? And the answer would be nothing. All right? This is like the scariest book ever. I bet it's way better than that classic of yours.

Okay. Ah, well we'll just see about that, okay. I will read The Shining, and you will read Little Women.

All right, you got it.

All right.

Okay.

Okay.

Ah, now Rach, these ah, these little women.

Yeah.

How little are they? I mean, are they like scary little?

So when people complement me on my cooking should I, what do I say?

You say 'Thank you very much,' and then you buy me something pretty. Come on, we're gonna put are hands in this bowl, and we're gonna start squishing the tomatoes.

Ew, this feels very weird.

You touch people's eyeballs every day and this feels weird.

Yeah, well, sure I touch them, but I spent years learning not to squish them. That's my hand.

Oops.

Okay.

Gotta keep squishing.

Tomatoes are squishing.

Okay.

Op.

Oh, gosh, you got some on your shirt.

Yeah.

Hold on a second, just put a little club soda on it and it should umm, be.....

What?

Umm, you've got some on your pants.

I'll just throw them out.

So we can be friends who sleep together.

Absolutely, this will just be something we do, like racquetball.

Sounds smart and healthy to me. So um, just out of curiosity, um, do you currently have any other racquetball buddies?

Just your dad. Although that's actually racquetball. You know I-I do have a blind date with my sister's neighbour next Tuesday.

Oh.

You want me to cancel it?

No! No!

Okay.

'Cause if you do that means you'd be cancelling it for me, and we're just friends.

Exactly.

Hi.

Sorry. I'm sorry.

You would not believe my day! I had to work two shifts, and then to top it off, I lost one of my fake boobs, in a grill fire.

What are you smiling at?

I'm sorry, I was just thinking you're day could still pick up.

Yeah, right.

Hello.

I love this friend thing!

Listen, Robert's gonna be here any second so, will one of you just tell him?

Oh.

Please, right now, no, every time I see him it's like 'Is it on the lose?' 'Is it watching me?'

We can't tell him, you can't go up to a guy you barely know and talk about his.... stuff.

He's right, even if it's to say something complementary.

Hey!

Hey.

So are ready for the gym? They've got this new rock climbing wall, we can spot each other.

No, I can spot you from here.

What?

Okay, listen Robert...

Hey, don't we have to...

Yeah, we got, um-hmm.

Umm, I think you're really, really great...

Oh God! Here we go again. Why does this keep happening to me? Is it something I'm putting out there? Is this my fault? Or am I just nuts?

I-I-I-I-I don't know, I don't know what to say.

Hey buddy, this is a family place, put the mouse back in the house.

What?

Beth is really, really sick.

Awwww.

Jo's there, but I don't think there's anything she could do.

Joey?

Yeah.

Do you want to put the book in the freezer?

Okay.

Okay.
