So ah, your first sexual experience was with a woman?!

All right, I was 15, it was my best friend, Ruth, and we got drunk on that hard cider, and then suddenly, I don't know, we were, we were making out.

Tell it again. Seriously.

I mean is that woman capable of talking about anything else but sex?

Yeah, sure. Well y'know, earlier she was talking about geography.

Joey, she was listing the countries she's done it in.

Well, I think we all learned something.

Hey, you guys! Look what I found! Look at this! That's my Mom's writing! Look.

Me and Frank and Phoebe, Graduation 1965.

Y'know what that means?

That you're actually 50?

No-no, that's not, that's not me Phoebe, that's her pal Phoebe. According to her high school yearbook, they were like B.F.F. Best Friends Forever.

Oh!

That is so cool.

I know! So this woman probably could like have all kinds of stories about my parents, and she might even know like where my Dad is. So I looked her up, and she lives out by the beach. So maybe this weekend we could go to the beach?

Yeah! Yeah, we can!

Shoot! I can't go, I have to work!

That's too bad.

Ohh, big, fat bummerrr.

So great! Okay! Tomorrow we're gonna drive out to Montauk.

Hey, Bonnie had sex there!

Go, go, go!

Oh yeah, now everybody wants to be under this hat!

Oy!!

What's with all this sand?

Oh, yeah, Bob said there might be flood damage.

Yeah, either that, or he has a really big cat.

Well, yes, it's kind've an unusual house. It has umm, three beautiful bedrooms and ah, no baths. But y'know, the ocean is right there.

Knock, knock, knock.

Ah, oh, hang on a second. Come in, come in. All right, so think about it, and call me back.

Are you ah, Phoebe Abott?

Ahh, yes.

Hi Phoebe Abott, I'm your best friends daughter!

You're Erwin's daughter?!

No, I-I mean your-your old best friend, here. Lily, from high school. Remember?

Oh gosh, Lily, yes. Of course I remember Lily. I... Then you must be?

Phoebe. Phoebe. Phoebe, yeah. She named me after you I guess.

Uh-huh. Wow! Well, look! There's Frank.

Yes!! Yes! Yes! Yes!! That's my Dad, that's Frank! Yeah! I'm sorry I'm getting all flingy.

Take it easy--if you want, there's cookies on the counter, or, or--sangria! I can make sangria!

No-no, sorry. Cookies are good, thanks.

Oh.

Well, so, umm, anyway umm, I've been, I've been looking for my Father, and umm, have you heard from him, or seen him?

Oh no, I-I'm sorry, I guess we lost track of everybody after high school.

Oh, okay. Well, so tell me everything about my parents. Everything.

Ohh, well. Y'know we were always together, in fact the had a nickname for the three of us.

Oh, what? What was it?

The three losers. Oh, poor Lily. Ohh, y'know I-I heard about what happened, that must have been just terrible for you, losing your mother that way.

Yeah, no, it was great.

So, you still don't think I'm boyfriend material?

Huh?

I saw you checking me out during the game last night.

You didn't even take off your pants.

Yeah, well, lucky for you.

What?

I don't know.

Well! Is everybody else having just the best time?!

Shhh! Shhhh! Joey's asleep.

After he passed out, we put the sand around him to keep him warm.

Well I assume the ah, happy couple isn't up yet. Did you guys hear them last night?

Oh, yeah, I don't know what they were doing, but at one point sea turtles actually came up to the house.

Good morning.

Hey.

Hey! How did everybody sleep?

Oh, great.

Like a log.

Us too.

I'm going for a walk.

Good morning. Nice breasts by the way.

Hey, what happened to you?

Oh, ah nothin'. I just felt like hangin' out here and reading.

Oh, the water was sooo great! We jumped off this pier and my suit came off.

Ohhhh, sorry I missed that.

Yeah, Joey and Chandler sure are funny.

Ohh-ha-ha!

I think I brought back half of the beach in my hair. It was so much easier when I used to shave my head.

Y'know, I gotta tell ya, I just loved your look when you were bald.

Really?!

Ohh!

Because I think about shaving it all off again sometime.

Really?!

Yeah!

I mean you definitely should do that.

Y'know what, I should do it.

Yeah!

Yeah, thank you Rachel, you are soo cool.

Awww, stop. Come on. Now go shave that head!

All right.

What's the matter, Pheebs?

She cancelled! My namesake cancelled on me!

What?!

Yeah, she clamed she had to go out of town suddenly. She's avoiding me, she doesn't want to tell me where my Father is. She knows, and she won't tell me.

Aww Pheebs, that sucks!

Yeah, well, don't "Aww Pheebs, that sucks!" me yet.

Where ya going?

Well, she's out of town so, there's gotta be something in her house that tells me where my Father is.

Uh, Pheebs, some people call that breaking and entering.

Well, are any of those people here?!

Oh, no!! No, no!

Okay, look I-I-I do something nice, okay? I'll-I'll fill her ice trays.

Hey, everybody!

Wow!!

Wh-haa-haa! Look what 'cha did!

You wanna touch it?

Nooo, but it, but it's great.

Come on, touch it!

Okay. You can feel all the bones in your skull.

Ow! My ass. Okay. Okay. Oh, shhh!

No! No!! It's me! It's me! I-I didn't want to make any noise!

Then don't break in!!

I'm sorry.

What are you doing here?!

I-I, came to fill your ice cube trays.

What?!

Umm, okay, okay, look. I took this picture from your fridge. Okay, because I know that this is my Father. Yeah, this is Frank Buffay and you are standing right there next to him. Now, look I deserve to know where I came from. All right? So if you can help me find my Father then you should! Otherwise, you're just mean! So, just tell me the truth!

All right, the man in the picture is Chuck Magioni.

My Father is Chuck Magioni?

No, no, that's just Chuck Magioni, I-I sold him a house last year! And I'm very sorry, but I don't know where your Father is, and that's the truth.

Oh.

But umm, you're right. I think that a person should know where they come from. Wh-which is why I ah, ahh, okay. I'm your mother.

Heh?

Y'know I wanted to tell you yesterday, but I just, I kinda felt all floopy, and...

I'm telling ya, you guys are totally getting back together!

That's not true! Her, she doesn't even know what she wants! Rachel's still mad about the whole thing.

Okay, then you gotta back away, all right? You don't need that kind've hurt. Take it from a guy who's never had a long term relationship......

I know, but ahhhhhh!! I really wanna go up there and finish that kiss!

Hey!

Ahhhh!

You guys, the water's great. You should really go in.

Oh, ahh, no thanks, I just had an M&M.

Okay, well g'night.

Good night.

Don't be too long.

Okey-dokey!

There is not one hair on that head.

Hey, it'll grow back, right? And she-she's really fun, and she's cool, and-and I'm finally moving on. Y'know? I mean getting over Rachel was so , y'know? Y'know, and I'm finally feeling sane again. And now if I go up there, and-and I kiss her, and, Gooood I wanna kiss her, and-and-and it doesn't work out, right? Do I really wanna put myself through that again?

So let me get this straight. If you go with Bonnie tonight, you're doing the smart, healthy thing and moving on.

Yeah.

Right, and you go with Rachel, Bonnie's free tonight?
