Morning's here! Sunshine is here! The sky is clear, the morning's here! The morning's here!

HEY!! Do you have to do that? It's Saturday!

Oh come on! Morning's here! Morning's here! The morning is here! Sunshine is here!

I hate this apartment! I hate the color of these walls! I hate the fact that this place still smells like bird! I hate that singing guy!

Are you kidding? I love that guy! Morning's here! Morning is here-

Stop it! I will kill you. I hate the fact that my room is so small.

Hey, I have all the space I need. Just do what I did.

Monica, you don't even have a bed, you sleep in a ball on the floor!

Y'know what? I am really tired of your bellyaching! Okay, I-I worked really hard at making this a nice place for us to live!

I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

Okay.

See, this is a great apartment.

Shut up! This place is a hole!

Oh, blimey, I still can't believe you've got an earring!

Huh? I know, I know. Who am I? David Bowe?

He does that?!

Uh, I don't know, whatever.

I think it makes you look really dangerous.

Oh, I know. Y'know what, I never would've gotten this if it weren't for you. No really, when I'm with you I'm-I'm like this whole other guy, I love that guy! I mean, I love you too, a lot, but that guy! I-I love that guy!

I love both of you!

Yeah?

I wish I didn't have to go.

Then don't. Stay here. Just don't go so soon to London, just one more day.

Ohh, Ross, please!

One more day, seriously/

Don't do this to me, again. You'd know I'd stay here in a minute, but I'd really miss so much work, they'll fire me.

So, then you can stay as long as you want.

I wish I could.

Oh no. Don't, don't, don't start packing. Come on!

I don't think you understand packing. Look, I just don't want to leave it to the last minute. Last time I left in such a rush, I left my knickers here.

Yeah, I know, I uh, I tried them on.

You didn't!

No. No, I didn't. I didn't want to be that guy.

Morning's here! The morning's here!

Sunshine is here! The sky is clear, the morning's here!

Hey! You're back!

Hey! Get into gear!

Breakfast is near!

The dark of night has disappeared!!

I'll see you tomorrow morning!

Okay!
