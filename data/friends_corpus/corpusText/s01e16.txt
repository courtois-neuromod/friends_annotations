This is unbelievable. Its been like a half an hour. If this was a cartoon, youd be looking like a ham right about now.

Theres the waitress. Excuse me, Miss. Hello, Miss?

Its Phoebe! Hi!

Hi. Okay, will that be all?

Wait, wait! Wh-what are you doing here?

Yeah, um, I was over there, then you said, "Excuse me, hello Miss," so now Im here.

No, no... how come you are working here?

Right, yeah, cause its close to where I live, and the aprons are really cute.

Can we start over?

Yeah. Okay great. Im gonna be over here.

No, no, no!

Hi, were the Rostins. Err, Im J.C., and hes Michael, and were having a boy, and a girl.

Good for you. Alrighty, next?

Hi, um, Im err, Im Ross Geller, and err ah... ..thats, thats my boy in there, and uh, this is Carol Willick, and this... is Susan Bunch. Susan is um Carols, just, com... ..whos next?

Im sorry, I didnt get... Susan is?

Susan is Carols, Carols, Carols, friend...

Life partner.

Like buddies.

Like lovers.

You know how close women can get.

Susan and I live together.

Although I was married to her.

Carol, not me.

Err, right.

Its a little complicated.

A little.

But were fine.

Absolutely. So, twins... hah! Thats like two births. Ouch.

And to you too, Helen.

Nina Bookbinder is here to see you.

Oh, okay. Send her in.

Hi.

Hi, Nina. Come on in.

You wanted to see me?

Uh, Yes. Yes. Ive just been going over your data here, and little thing, youve been post-dating your Friday numbers.

Which is bad, because?

Well, it throws my WENUS out of whack.

Your... excuse me?

WENUS. Weekly Estimated Net...

Oh, Net Usage Statistics, right. Gotcha, gotcha. Wont happen again. I wouldnt want to do anything to hurt your... "wenus."

Sorry.

Hi. Sorry Im late. Wheres, wheres Carol?

Stuck at school. Some parent-teacher thing. You can go. I'll get the information.

No... No... No. I think I should stay, I think we should both know whats going on.

Oh, good. Thisll be fun.

Alrighty. Were gonna start with some basic third stage breathing exercises, so Mummies, why dont you get on your back? And... coaches, you should be supporting Mummys head.

What? What? What?

I am supposed to be the mommy?

Okay, I'm gonna play my sperm card one more time.

Look, I dont see why I should have to miss out on the coaching training just because I'm a woman.

I see. So what do you propose to do?

I will flip you for it.

Flip me for it? No, no, no... heads, heads, heads!

On your back... Mom.

Alright, Mommies, take a nice deep cleansing breath.

Good. Now imagine your vagina is opening like a flower.

Mr. D, hows it going, sir?

Ohh, its been better. The Annual Net Usage Statistics are in.

And?

Its pretty ugly. We havent seen an ANUS this bad since the seventies.

So what does this mean?

Well, were gonna be layin off people in every department.

Hey, listen, I know I came in late last week, but I slept funny, and my hair was very very &ndash;

Not you. Relax. Ever have to fire anyone?

Nina? Nina. Nina. Nina.

Are you okay?

Yes, yes I am. Err, listen, the reason that I called you in here today was, err... please dont hate me.

What?

Would you like to have dinner sometime?

And thats the Chrysler Building right there.

Nina.

Mr.Douglas... ..cool tie.

Shes still here.

Yes, yes she is. Didnt I memo you on this? See, after I let her go, err, I got a call from her psychiatrist, Dr. Flanen-nen, Dr. Flanen, Dr. Flan.

And err, he informed me that uh, she took the news rather badly, in fact, he uh, mentioned the word frenzy.

Youre kidding? She seems so...

Oh, no, no. Nina... ..she is whooo wewee-woo whoo whoo! In fact, if you asked her right now, she would have no recollection of being fired at all, none at all.

Thats unbelievable.

And yet, believable. So I decided not to fire her again until I can be assured that she will be no threat to herself, or others.

I see. I guess you never really know whats goin on inside a persons head.

Well, I guess thats why they call it psychology, sir.

..a sound Mom and Dad never forget. For this after all, is the miracle of birth.

Lights please? And thats having a baby. Next week is our final class.

Susan, go deep.

This is impossible. Its just impossible.

What is, honey?

What that woman... did. I am not doin that. Its just gonna have to stay in, thats all, everything will be the same, itll just stay in.

Carol, honey, shhh, shhh, everythings gonna be alright.

Oh, what do you know? No one's going up to you and saying, "Hi, is that your nostril? Mind if we push this pot roast through it?"

Carol, Carol, sweetie. Cleansing breath.

I know its frightening, but, big picture. The birth part is just one day, and when its over, were all gonna be parents for the rest of our lives.

I mean, thats what this is all about, right? Ross? Ross?

Im gonna be a father.

This is just occurring to you?

I always knew I was havin a baby, I just never realised the baby was having me.

Oh, youre gonna be great!

Aw, how can you say that? I cant even get Marcel to stop eating the bath mat. How am I gonna raise a kid?

You know, Ross, some scientists are now saying that, that monkeys and babies are actually different.

Wherere you going?

Out.

With?

Yes.

Alright, could I just ask you one question?

Have you two, you know... like... you know... you know... yet?

Well, not that its any of your business, but, no, we havent, okay?

You meant sex, right?

Do you have a sec?

Ah, sure, Nina. Whats up?

I dont know. For the past couple days, people have been avoiding me and giving me these really strange looks.

Oh, well, ah... maybe thats because theyre ah... jealous, of us.

Maybe. But that doesnt explain why they keep taking my scissors.

Ah, well, maybe thats, ah, because youre getting a big raise.

I am?

Sure, why not?

Oh my god! Youre amazing!

Oh, you dont know. Helen, could you make sure we put through the paperwork on Miss Bookbinders raise?

So you still want me to send her psychological profile to Personnel?

What?

Helen drinks. Will you marry me?

Well, I ended up telling her everything.

Oh, howd she take it?

Pretty well. Except for the stapler thing. Little tip: if youre ever in a similar situation, never ever leave your hand... ..on the desk.

Okay, I think I get how to do this.

Alright, so, can we turn this off? Can we just make it... make them go away? Because I cant, I cant watch.

okay, Pheebs, theyre gone.

Okay.

Are you alright?

Yeah. Its just, you know, its this whole stupid Ursula thing, its...

Okay, Pheebs, can I ask? So, hes going out with her. I mean, is it really so terrible?

Um, yeah. Look, I mean, Im not saying shes like evil or anything. She just, you know, shes always breaking my stuff. When I was eight, and I wouldnt let her have my Judy Jetson thermos, so she threw it under the bus. And then, oh, and then there was Randy Brown, who was like... Have you ever had a boyfriend who was like your best friend?

No.

Well, but thats what he was for me. And she you know, kind of stole him away, and then... broke his heart... and then he wouldnt even talk to me any more. Because he said he didnt wanna be around... anything that looked like either one of us.

Oh... Oh, Pheebs.

I mean, I know Joey is not my boyfriend, or my thermos, or anything, but...

Youre not gonna lose him.

Hon, you gotta talk to Joey.

Yeah. Okay.

No, come on, he doesnt know this stuff. If he knew how you felt.

But hes falling in love with her.

Oh please, theyve been going out a week. They havent even slept together yet, I mean, thats not serious.

Okay... Okay.

Oh, okay, oh.

Oh.

Yeah, um, may we help you?

Rachel, what are you doing? Its freezing out here. Would you come back inside?

No no no no no. You wanted me to take them down, so... ..Im takin em down. Okay? Whoa!

Oh-my-god Rachel! Rachel!

Im okay! Im okay! Mr. Heckles, Mr. Heckles could you help me please?

See, this is just the kind of thing I was talking about.
