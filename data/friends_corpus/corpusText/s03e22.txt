Here you go. You can wear this.

Thanks!

Uh-huh.

Okay. Ooh, I'm setting the phone down. But I'm still here! Just don't go anywhere I'm still here. Don't-don't switch or anything, 'cause I'm, I'm right here. Just one sec. One sec! One second!! Wait! One second! Just...

Phoebe?

What?! Monica, I'm scared!!

All right. Honey, that's-that's a sleeve. Okay?

Yeah.

And! We also have speaker phone.

Please, stay on the line. Your call is important to us.

Okay, wait, you gotta hang up 'cause we're gonna be late.

Thank you for your patience, you're the next caller.

Yes!! Yes!! I'm the next caller! You were gonna have me hang up.

Hey! Can you take a duck and a chick to the theatre?

Of course not.

No.

Okay. I just wanted them to hear it from somebody else.

Hey!

Hey!

Oh, is the play over?

Yeah. Where were you?

Thank you for your patience, you're the next caller.

You were the next caller five hours ago. You must be going crazy.

Nah. I kept myself busy.

Oh, okay, yeah. I put your stuff in her room, and her stuff in your room.

Hey! Are you okay?

Fabulous.

Listen, drama critics they're nothing but, but people who couldn't make it as actors. You know what you should do?

Become a drama critic!

I am hurt! A plague on both your houses!

By the way, he dumped me tonight after he read my review.

Oh, classy.

Yep! I sure know how to pick 'em, huh? Y'know I gave up a part on a soap for this!

Wow! Yeah I ah, I gave up a job too.

Really. What?

Uh, de-clawing cats. Hey, tell ya what. Let me walk you home. We'll stop by every news stand and burn every copy of their Times and the Post.

Why the Post?

Oh, you didn't see the Post?

No. You?

No. Why?

So you really think those newspapers are just jealous of me?

Oh, absolutely! You're talented and you're good looking.

Oh, you're sweet and cute.

I know! That's why they trashed me!

Whoa. Wait a minute, wait a minute.

What?

I, I don't get you. I mean first, you hate me. Then you sleep with me. Then you want nothing to do with me, now you want me again.

What? So you never went out with an actress before?

Kate, do you even like me?

Of course I do.

Well so, how come you blew me off? Y'know? How come you were with him?

I don't know! I just, just do this! I-I always have to pick the like the smartest guy, or-or the most talented guy... Why can't I just pick someone like you?

Thanks.

You know what I mean. I mean like the sweetest guy. Joey, you're just so, you're so, so...

Okay. Okay, okay, hey. There we go, let's get your feet up there. Good night, Kate. Sweet dreams. I'm gonna put this can right here in case you have to hurl.

Please stay on the line. You're call is very important to us.

Pheebs, you've been up for 24 hours! Go to sleep, honey. Th-this isn't healthy.

No, no, I'm fine, and y'know why? 'Cause of all the riboflavin.

Hey!

Hey! Didn't you have that outfit on last night?

Yeah! I stayed at Kate's, but ah, nothing happened. Hey, Pheebs, where were ya?

I'm so, so, so sorry, Joey. I definitely am gonna see you're play. I swear you're play is very important to us, thank you for your patience. You're play is the next play is the next play I'm gonna see.

Anyway, how did it go with Kate?

Oh, it was great! Yeah, I-I walked her home, and it was amazing how much we connected, y'know? Then ah, then she passed out, but then she woke up. Yeah? And we stayed up all night talking, and now we're like totally crazy about each other!

Joey, you had the night!

What?

When two people finally realise their feelings for each other, and-and they talk for hours, and they-they learn all about the other person!

You-you think?

Did you like learn about her family?

Two brothers, one died!

Yes!!

Yeah?!

Oh!

Sorry! Sorry, I'm late; sorry, I'm late! My duck and my chick and a fight, it-it was ugly.

Look, we held the curtain for you buddy. Come on, let's go! Let's go!

Vic! Where have you been, baby?!

Where's Kate?

She got a job in L.A.

What?!

I've been waiting up all night for ya. Where have you been? Where have you been? Vic?!

Oh, ahh, go to the window. I'm wanna run down to the truck and show you something.

What do you got down there, Vic? What do you got under that tarp?

When is she leaving?

Tonight. What are you doing?

I'm coming up!

Hey, mind if I use the phone?

Oh, I...

Why don't you use ours across the hall, 'cause she...has...problems.

Oh-ho, whoa! Sorry, Tommy. I almost spilled this hot coffee on you.

Yeah, but you didn't.

No, but it's-it's-it's hot!

Ross, would you just stop it! It's getting really old.

I can't believe no one believes me!

I do, I believe you.

You do Pheebs?

Yeah. But I also believed her when she said I was next.

Ooh, hey! Hey, there little fella. Mr. Fuzzy-Man, how are you doing? Aww. Eww! Oh! Eww! Gross! Idiot!! Stupid little, fuzzy, yellow creature!! Oh look at me, I'm so cute, I'm a little chick who's disgusting! God, you're so stupid, how are you not yet extinct!! Quack-quack, quack-quack!! What are you quacking about?! Dumb Donald Doo-Doo!!

Step away from the duck.

Ooh, sorry little Mr. Chic-A-Dee, sorry you went doody in my hand! Well, I guess we're not going out anymore. Whaa!!!

Joey!

Hey!

I'm soo glad I caught you, I couldn't find you before.

Wh-wh-what's going on? Wh-what's this about L.A.?

They still want me for General Hospital.

But, but wh-what about us?

Last night was wonderful. But I-I can't stay here just for you.

Well, so, stay for the museums!

I'm sorry.

Joey, onstage!

Well can you at least stay to the end of the play? I mean, I'll go to the airport with ya, I-I wanna say good bye.

Where are you Vic?

Flight's in an hour. I-I gotta go.

Vic! Vic! Vic!!!

In a minute!!

So this is it? Victor?

Yeah, I guess it is. Listen, I ah, I gotta say good bye, and-and I gotta say it quick 'cause this is killing me. One thing you gotta know, is that I will never forget you. But, you've got things you have to do now, and so do I. And so... I'm gonna get on this spaceship, and I'm gonna go to Blargon 7 in search of alternative fuels. But when I return, 200 years from now, you'll be long gone. But I won't have aged at all. So you tell your great-great-granddaughter to look me up, because Adrienne, baby, I'm gonna want to meet her.

So long, Vic!

Phoebe, it's been two days.

Yeah, I know. Oh, good thing it's one of those 801 numbers. Right?

Phoebe, 800 is toll free, 801 is-is Utah.

No, no, no, oh no-no-no, it's has to be 800. 'Cause all those big companies have 800 numbers, every one. Yeah, every big Utah-based company has one.

Phoe-be!!

Sorry, I'm so sorry, I will pay you back.

And yet, she's still not hanging up the phone.

Hang it up! Hang up the phone!!

Fine! Fine! Oh-oh!

What?

Well, I think I broke it. But that's all right, here's the number you can call.

Oh.
