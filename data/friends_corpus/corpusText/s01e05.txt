Would you let it go? It's not that big a deal.

Not that big a deal? It's amazing. Ok, you just reach in there, there's one little maneuver, and bam, a bra right out the sleeve. All right, as far as I'm concerned, there is nothing a guy can do that even comes close. Am I right?

Come on! You guys can pee standing up.

We can? All right, I'm tryin' that.

Ok, you know what blows my mind? Women can see breasts any time they want. You just look down and there they are. How you get any work done is beyond me.

Oh, ok, you know what I don't get? The way guys can do so many mean things, and then not even care.

Multiple orgasms!

Monica, I'm tellin' you, this guy is perfect for you.

Forget it. Not after your cousin who could belch the alphabet.

Come on. This guy's great. His name's Bob. He's Angela's... brother. He's smart, he's sophisticated, and he has a real job. Me, I go on three auditions a month and call myself an actor, but Bob is...

Oh, god help us.

What?

Ugly Naked Guy's laying kitchen tile. Eww!

Eww! Look, I'm asking a favor here. If I do this for her brother, maybe Angela will come back to me.

What's going on here? You go out with tons of girls.

I know, but, I made a huge mistake. I never should have broken up with her. Will you help me? Please?

Ok, bye. Well, Monica's not coming, it's just gonna be me and Rachel.

Oh. Well, hold on camper, are you sure you've thought this thing through?

It's laundry. The thinking through is minimal.

It's just you and Rachel, just the two of you? This is a date. You're going on a date.

Nuh-uh.

Yuh-huh.

So what're you saying here? I should shave again, pick up some wine, what?

Well, you may wanna rethink the dirty underwear. This is basically the first time she's gonna see your underwearyou want it to be dirty?

No.

Oh, and uh, the fabric softener?

Ok, ok, now what is wrong with my Snuggles? What, it says I'm a sensitive, warm kinda guy, you know, like a warm, fuzzy bear. Ok, I can pick something else up on the way.

There you go.

Thank you. So what does this Bob guy look like? Is he tall? Short?

Yep.

Which?

Which what?

You've never met Bob, have you?

No, but he's...

Oh my god, Joey, for all we know this guy could be horribly...

Hey, Joey.

...horribly attractive. I'll be shutting up now.

Where are they? Where are they?

This is nice. We never do anything just the two of us.

It's great. Maybe tomorrow we can rent a car and run over some puppies.

Eww, I don't wanna do that.

Here we go.

Ok, have a good break-up.

Hey, Janice.

Oh, my god, I am so glad you called me. I had the most supremely awful day.

Hey, that's not good. Can I get an espresso and a latte over here, please?

We got the proofs back from that photo shoot, you know, the one with the little vegetables. Anyway, they pretty much sucked, so, I blew off the rest of the day, and I went shopping... ... and I got you, I'm looking, I'm looking, I'm looking, I got you...

What?

What?

What... did you get me there?

I got you...these.

Bullwinkle socks. That's so sweet.

Well, I knew you had the Rockys, and so I figured, you know, you can wear Bullwinkle and Bullwinkle, or you can wear Rocky and Rocky,or, you can mix and match, moose and squirrel. Whatever you want.

That's great.

Well, I'm gonna get another espresso. Can I get you another latte?

No, no, I'm still working on mine.

That's it?

Yeah, it was really hard.

Oh, yeah, that hug looked pretty brutal.

Ok, you weren't there.

He is so cute. So, where did you guys grow up?

Brooklyn Heights.

Cleveland.

How, how did that happen?

Oh my god.

What?

I suddenly had the feeling that I was falling. But I'm not.

So, you and Angela, huh?

Yep. Pretty much.

You're a lucky man. You know what I miss the most about her? That cute nibbly noise when she eats. Like a happy little squirrel, or a weasel.

Huh, I never really noticed.

Oh, yeah, yeah, listen for it.

Monica, Monica is great.

Yeah, but it's not gonna last. She's too much for me in bed. Sexually.

I've gotta tell you, Bob is terrific.

Yeah, isn't he?

It is so great to meet a guy who is smart and funny, and has an emotional age beyond, like eight.

You know what else? He's unbelievable in bed.

Wow. My brother never even told me when he lost his virginity.

Huh. That's nice.

Ok, I know this is gonna sound really stupid, but I feel that if I can do this, you know, if I can actually do my own laundry, there isn't anything I can't do.

That does not sound stupid to me. You know, it's like the first time I had to make dinner for myself, after Carol left me? I'm sorry, that's all the time we have. Next on Ross... Uh-oh.

What uh-oh?

Uh-oh, uh-oh, the laundry's done. It's, uh, it's a song. The laundry song that we sing. Uh-oh the laundry's done, uh-oh, uh-oh.

Ross, what's the matter?

Nothing, nothing. Lee-lo, the laundry's done.

Come on, show me.

All right, all right, it's just that you left a red sock in with all your whites, and now, everything's kinda pink.

Oh, everything's pink.

Yeah, uh, except for the red sock, which is still red. I'm sorry, please don't be upset, it could happen to anyone.

Except it didn't. It happened to me. Oh, god, I'm gonna look like a big marshmallow peep. What am I doing? What am I doing? My father's right. I can't live on my own! I can't even do laundry!

Something went wrong with Underdog, and they couldn't get his head to inflate. So anyway, um, his head is like flopping down Broadway, right, and I'm just thinking... how inappropriate this is. Um, I've got something in my eye, uh, Joey, could we check it in the light, please?

Oh my god.

What?

Hello! Were we at the same table? It's like... cocktails in Appalachia.

Come on, they're close.

Close? She's got her tongue in his ear.

Oh, like you've never gotten a little rambunctious with Ross.

Joey, this is sick, it's disgusting, it's, it'snot really true, is it?

Well, who's to say what's true? I mean...

Oh my god, what were you thinking?

All right, look, I'm not proud of this, ok? Well, maybe I am a little.

Oh!

Ow!

I'm outta here.

Wait, wait, wait. You want him, I want her. He likes you.

Really?

Yeah. I'm thinking, if we put our heads together, between the two of us, we can break them up.

I'm so sorry, I can't believe I did this, but I couldn't stop laughing at your Norman Mailer story.

Uh, waiter, one more plate of chicken wings over here.

Here's the thing, Janice. You know, I mean, it's like we're different. I'm like the bing, bing, bing. You're like the boom, boom, ... boom.

Ow!

Oh, my god, I'm so sorry. Are you ok?

Ow. Um, it's just my lens. It's just my lens. I'll be right back.

I hit her in the eye! I hit her in the eye! This is the worst break-up in the history of the world.

Oh my god. How many of those have you had?

Oh, I don't know, a million?

Chandler, easy, easy. Go to your happy place. La la la la la la la.

I'm fine.

All right.

I'm not fine. Here she comes.

Wait here. Breathe.

How do you do that?

It's like a gift.

We should always always break up together.

Oh, I'd like that.

You got the clothes clean. Now that's the important part.

Oh, I guess. Except everything looks like jammies now.

Whoa, I'm sorry. Excuse me. We had this cart.

Yeah, well, I had a 24-inch waist. You lose things. Now come on, get outta my way.

I'm sorry, you know, maybe I wasn't being clear. Uh, this is our cart.

Hey, hey, hey there aren't any clothes in it.

Hey, hey, hey, hey, quit making up rules!

Let go!

All right, listen, missy. If you want this cart, you're gonna have to take me with it!

Yes! Did you see that?

You were incredible! Brand new woman, ladies and gentlemen.

I could not have done this without you.

Ok, um, uh, more clothes in the dryer? I'm fine, I'm fine.

Are you sure?

No.

Oh, are you sure you're ok?

Yeah.

Does it still hurt?

Yeah.

What a neat idea. All your clothes match. I'm gonna do this.

Hi.

Hey, how'd it go?

Excellent.

We ripped that couple apart, and kept the pieces for ourselves.

What a beautiful story. Hey, I'm fine by the way.

Oh, I'm sorry.

Where's Chandler?

Oh, he needed some time to grieve.

I'm free! I'm free!

That oughta do it.
