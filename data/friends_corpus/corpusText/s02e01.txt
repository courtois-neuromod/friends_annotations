Oh my god. Oh my god. Excuse me. Move! Move! Emergency! Excuse me!

Rach!

Oh, there you are! Hi! Oh, so, so, how was China, you?

It was, it was great. Oh, what happened?

What?

You're bleeding.

I am? Oh, look at that, yes I am. Enough about me, enough about me, Mr. Back from the Orient. Come on. I wanna hear everything! Everything.

Well, where do I start? This is Julie. Julie, this is Rachel.

These are, these aren't for you. These are for you. Welcome to our country.

Thank you. I'm from New York.

Ok, well, not a problem. We'll just use them to stop the bleeding. Ok. Baggage claim? Ok.

Hey, Rach, can I get some coffee?

Yeah, sure.

Thank you.

Hey, Rach, can I get...

Did you talk to him?

Not yet.

Then, no.

So what the hell happened to you in China? I mean, when last we left you, you were totally in love with, you know.

I know, I know I was, but there was always this little voice inside that kept saying it's never gonna happen, move on. You know whose voice that was?

God?

It was you, pal.

Well, maybe it was God, doing me.

Look, you were right. She looks at me and sees a friend, that's all. But then I met Julie, and I don't know, we're havin' a great time. And I have to say, I never would've gone for it with her if it hadn't been for you.

Well, you owe me one, big guy.

Here's your lemonade.

I didn't order lemonade.

Oh. Well then, you better go take that back because they're gonna charge you for that.

But...

Go-go-go-go, come on! So uh, what did you find out?

He said...he said, he said that they're having a great time. I'm sorry. But, the silver lining, if you wanna see it, is that he made the decision all by himself! Without any outside help whatsoever.

How is that the silver lining?

You have to really wanna see it.

You know, I think I was sixteen.

Please, just a little bit off the back.

I'm still on "no."

Uh, morning. Do you guys think you could close your eyes for just a sec?

No-no-no-no-no, I'm not fallin' for that again.

What's goin' on?

Well, I sorta did a stupid thing last night.

What stupid thing did you do?

Bon giorno tutti!

Ewww!

All right, that's it, I quit.

What? I didn't say anything.

Yeah, but this isn't the face of a person who trusts a person. Ok, this is the face of a person who, you know, doesn't trust a person.

I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Phoebe. It's just a little shorter than what we had discussed.

Would you relax? I know what I am doing. This is how he wears it.

How who wears it?

Demi Moore.

Demi Moore is not a he.

Well, he was a he in Arthur, and in Ten.

That's Dudley Moore. I said I wanted it like Demi Moore.

Oh. Oh!

Oh my God!

Oh my God!

Oh my God!

Oh my God! I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Which one's Demi Moore?

She's the actress that was in Disclosure, Indecent Proposal, Ghost!

Oh, she's got gorgeous hair.

I know!

Even Mary Tyler Moore would've been better.

I like it. I do, I think it's a Ten.

Thank you. My hair is very amused.

Come on, Monica, things could be worse. You could get caught between the moon and New York City. I know it's crazy, but it's true.

Thank you.

Well, I gotta go. Bye. Bye, Rach.

Wait, are you leaving?

Yeah, that's kinda what I meant by "bye!"

Well, can I talk to you for a sec?

Okay.

Hey, when the doctor does that hernia test...

That's ok.

What's goin' on?

Well, first of all, Paulo and I are not back together. It was just a stupid thing I did, and if I could go back in time and do it again, well, I wouldn't. Um, second of all , what?

Ok. Well, before I say anything, I just need to know, is this one of those things where you break up with a guy, and then I tell you what I think, and then the next day you get back together with the guy, and I look like a complete idiot?

No. No-no-no-no.

Well, then, I think, I think the guy is scum. I hate him. I mean I actuallyI-I physically hate him. I always have. You are way too good to be with a guy like that.

Really?

You deserve to be with someone who appreciates you, and who gets how funny and sweet and amazing, and adorable, and sexy you are, you know? Someone who wakes up every morning thinking "Oh my god, I'm with Rachel". You know, someone who makes you feel good, the way I am with Julie. Was there a second of all?

No, I think that was the whole all.

Okay. Okay. Okay.

I swear to god, Dad. That's not how they measure pants.

I was thinking of doing it a little shorter, you know, like Andie McDowell's new haircut?

Oh yeah! Oh, I can do that.

Really?

You wanna do it right now?

Great!

Ok, I just wanna be really sure this time. Andie McDowell's the girl from Four Weddings and a Funeral, right?

No. No no no no no. That's Rodney McDowell. Andie McDowell is the guy from Planet of the Apes.

Oh, yeah. Ok, thank you.

You're welcome.
