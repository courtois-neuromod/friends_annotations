The Waltham Residence.

Oh...yes..is this..umm..Emily's Parents' house.

This is the housekeeper speaking. And by the way, young lady, that is not how one addresses a person on the telephone. First one identifies oneself and then asks for the person with whom one wishes to speak.

What are you saying?!

Now, let us try that again, shall we?

No! Ooh! Oh my god!

The Waltham Residence.

Hello. This is Phoebe Buffay. I was wondering, please, if-if it's not too much trouble, please, umm, might I speak to Miss Emily Waltham, please?

Miss Waltham, is at the rehearsal dinner and it's not polite to make fun of people. Goodbye.

No no no, I'll be nice, I swear!!! Could you just give me the number for where they are?

I'm afraid, I'm not at liberty to divulge that information.

Ok, somebody is on their way to ruin wedding okay. And I have to warn somebody, alright. So if you don't give me that number then I'm going to come over there and kick your snooty ass all the way to New Glocken..shire.

Hangs up.

Hello, Hello. Ohh, OHH, she knew I could kick her ass.

Hey.

Hi. Mom. Dad.

Sweetheart. Oh sorry were late, my fault, I insisted on riding the tube.

Judy, the kids..

Jack, that's what they call the subway.

Ohh, I thought that you....

Dad, dad. We got it!! We Got It!!!

Ohh, here comes my dad and stepmum. Mister and Misses Geller, this is Steven and Andrea Waltham.

Hello. Hello. How do you do? How do you do? Very nice to meet you. Darling it's the Gellers. Darling, it's the Gellers. She's very self-absorbed, you know. I should never have married her.

Sorry, what?

It's the Gellers!

Where?

Well there's one and there's another .

Lovely to meet you.

Terribly nice of you to offer to pay for half the wedding.

Ohh forget it. Too hell with tradition, we're happy to do it.

We know how expensive weddings can be, besides this may be the only wedding we get to throw .

Ha ha, a joke that's funny in all countries.

Sir?

What's in it?

Goat cheese, water chestnuts, and panchetta.

That's not food...No, I don't, no... Everything's different here...I want to go home. I...I miss my family. I miss the coffee house. I can't even remember what Phoebe looks like.

Joey, it's been three days, okay.. Your just a little homesick, Okay. Would you just try to relax. Just, just try to enjoy yourself.

Your different here too. Your mean in England.

What the hell!!!

what's up, Dad?

This bill for my half of the wedding. it's insane.

How could it be so much? The receptions at their house.

Flowers, liquor, recarpet first floor. New guest bath, landscaping. I'm paying to remodel this guys house. I'm going to give that son on a bitch, a piece of my mind.

Dad, dad, please. Look I don't want anything to upset Emily tonight. Alright, she's had a hard enough couple of days as it is. Now here, here, let me go talk to him, okay?

And you tell him no one takes advantage of the Gellers.

Ooh, Jack.... Sometimes I forget how powerful you can be.

And I'm going to go get drunk.

Ooh, ooh, ooh,ooh,ooh. Hi.

Hello.

Hello. Umm, when is your next flight to London?

There's one leaving in thirty minutes.

Ohh, good.

And I do have one seat left.

Ohh, thank you, thank you, thank you.

The last minute fare on this ticket is twenty seven hundred dollars.

Huh.. How about 600?

Sorry.

How about 600 and these earrings?

They prefer it if I don't barter.

Ohh, I just don't think I have enough left on my credit card.

Well you can split it with another credit card.

Ohh, okay, how about five. Ohh, thank you.

I'm just going to need to see your passport.

Okay, you know what? I don't have it, but I can tell you exactly where it is on my night stand, and...okay. But you know what? I have my drivers license and I have a twenty.

Look, face it, my father is not going to pay for the build-in barbecue and believe me you can kiss you gazebo goodbye. Now I might be able to get you the new lawn.

Ahh, then you have to give us the lawn ornaments.

I go back there with lawn ornaments, he's going to laugh in my face.

This is ridiculous. I mean we had an agreement. Will you say something, Steven?! Please!!!

Don't take that tone with me. All-all right you can.

I'd like to toast, Ross and Emily. Of course, my big toast will be tomorrow at the wedding, so this is kind of my little toast or Melba toast, if you will. Okay. I known Ross for a long time. In fact, I knew him when he was going out with his first girlfriend. And I thought things were going to work out for him.. Until the day he over inflated her. Ohh, Dear God..

Hello, Waltham Interiors.

Oh, hi, Mrs. Waltham. I need to speak with ether one of the best men, or Ross's sister Monica.

Who is this?

Oh, I'm Phoebe Buffay. I'm one of Ross's best friends.

Where did you get this number?

I got it from your maid. She's a bitch, but I wore her down.

Well, if you're one of Ross's best friends, why aren't you here?

Yeah, um, I can't fly. I'm having my brother's babies.

Oh, am I on the radio?

No..umm, could I talk to one of them? It's very very important.

No, I'm bored with you now. I'm going to cut you off.

Ohh! Okay, I'm going to have to kick her ass too.

And I'm sure we're all very excited that Ross and Emily are getting married at Montgomery Hall. I mean to think, my friend getting married in Monty Hall. Ohh, come on!! Monty Hall!! Lets make a Deal!! Come on, you people!! All right, forget it!! Congratulations, Ross and Emily.

Hey, best man number two, Joey Tribbiani. Now I'm not good with the jokes like Chandler here. Boy...but ahh, I just want to say congratulation to the happy couple. I first met Ross in this coffee house back home...Home...New York City...Where everybody knows my name. Well anyway, I love you guys. But not as much as I love America. Could we please..go home now?

Are you going home? I was hoping to get to know you better.

I'm not going anywhere, sweetheart.

I was laughing.

Out loud?

Well I didn't want everyone to think I was stupid.

So how are you doing?

My mother's driving me crazy, but Ross is getting married. I'm happy. I'm not going to let anything spoil that.

I just want to say that Ross is a wonderful young man.

Well, thanks, we like him.

My god!! You must have been a teenage when you had him.

There's no way in hell, I'm paying for it.

Look, were down to just one point. Could we please, maybe just settle it after the wedding.

All-right fine, but I just want to say, I'm not paying for your wine cellar. You thieving, would be speaking German if it weren't for us, cheap little man.

The guy was hammered, okay? There's no way, you look like Ross's mother.

Then why would he say it?

Because he's crazy. Okay? He came up to me earlier and thanked me for my very moving performance in Titanic.

Oh, my mother's right. I'm never going to get married.

Ahh, you know what? That is....Who wouldn't want you?

Ohh, Please?! I'm a single mom, with a thirty year old son!!

Hi, I'm back. Listen, I need to...

Hello.

Hello. I need to get on the 11 o'clock flight.

Oh I'm afraid that plane has already pulled away from the gate.

Okay, you know what? You're going to have to call that plane and tell them to swing around and come and pick me up.

I can't do that.

Sure, you know what? Come on, we'll just tell them that there was like a problem with like the "engine".

I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to step aside, Miss.

Look, If I don't get to London!! He is going to marry that other girl!!!

I can't imagine why.

All right, you know what? I am not leaving here, until you call that plane back!!

I'm getting married today!! Whoo-hoo!!

Morning, Ross.

I'm getting married, to..day!!

Yeah you are!!

Ahh, whoo-hoo!!

Do you think he knew I was here?

Ohhh.

Ahh, ahh, excuse me.

Yeah?

If you're planning on doing that throughout the entire flight. Please tell me now. So that I could that a sedative...or perhaps slip you one.

Oh. I'm sorry. I'm very sorry. Sorry. It's just, I'm ahh, I'm kinda excited. I'm, ahh, going to London to ahh, tell this guy that I love him and...

Well I've-I've never done that with you before.

Nope.

So, ahh, how are ya? How ya...How ya... You okay?

Yep, yep...You?

Yes...Yes..Uh-huh, You? We did you.

Well...I'd better get going.

Oh yea yea, absolutely.

Could you not look?

I don't want to look.

Hello?

Hey, were the hell have you been?!

Hey. I spent the night out. I met this cute bridesmaid. She is so...

I don't want to hear about her!!

Ahh Pheebs, you know you're still my number one girl.

No! No, we have an emergency. Okay? Rachel's coming to London.

Ohh great!!!

No it's not great. No, she's coming to tell Ross that she loves him.

But, he loves Emily?

I KNOW THAT!!! You have to stop her!! She's going to ruin the wedding!!

Okay.

All right, so, okay...

Hold on. Hold on. Rachel coming. Do...Something.

Okay, so I'm done my part, okay. It's your responsibility now, okay. The burden is off me, right?

Right!

So tell me about this girl?

...And so then I realised. All this stuff I had been doing. proposing to Joshua, lying to Ross about why I couldn't come to the wedding. Was all just a way of...

Oh, oh oh!! I'm sorry, can I interrupt? You know I just want to say..That you are a horrible, horrible person.

Ehh, pardon me?

You say you love this man, yet you're about to ruin the happiest day of his life. I'm afraid I have to agree with you friend Pheebs.. This is a..this is a...terrible, terrible plan.

But he has to know how I feel!

But why? He loves this...this Emily person. No good can come of this.

Well I-I think your wrong.

Oh-no.

Well, he doesn't really love her. I mean, it's just a rebound thing from me.... You'll see!

Fortunately, I won't. And by the way, it seems to be perfectly clear that you were on a break.

Do something..... Something....

Hey.

Hey.

Have you seen Monica?

I'm not seeing Monica.

What?

What?

Look we've got to find her. Phoebe just called!! Rachel's coming to tell Ross she loves him!!

Oh my god!

I know! That's why we got to find Monica!! You know where she is?

No!! Okay!! What's with the third degree?! Why don't you just shine a light in my eyes?!

Oh my God! It's like a fairyland.

I know, it's horrible isn't it?

Well, I love it. I only hope my wedding looks this good.

I just hope...

You can let some of them go by!

Pisst, Monica. Alright, we really need to start looking out for Rachel. I'll cover the front door. You watch that big hole at the back of the building and I got Chandler covering Ross.

Why would I care where Chandler is? You know uhh...You know sometimes I don't even like Chandler.

Okay.

I do. I do. I do.

Oh yea, your right. It's the second one.

Really?

Hello Joey.

Hey, Felicity.

Umm, I thought about you all day.

Yeah.

Um-hum. Talk New York to me again.

Fuggetaboutit. How you doin?

Mmm.

Oh, yeah.

There's nothing to discuss. We're not paying for your wine cellar.

You-you have to meet me in the middle here.

Hey, you keep pushing me on this, my foots going to meet the middle of your ass.

Dad!!

What-what's going on?!

Nothing, nothing. Everything's under control.

You want a piece of me, sir? Is that what your saying? You want a piece of me?

Okay! Okay! That's it!! Parents!! Parents!! Back away!! All right, this is our wedding day! From now on everyone gets along, and if I hear one more word. NO GRANDCHILDREN! That's right!!

Okay, okay.

Sorry old boy, sorry. Sorry. Sorry. I could kill you with my thumb, you know.

What was all that about?

It was...This disagreement over... My god. You...you look beautiful.

Ohh... Oh! You were not meant to see me before the wedding. It's bad luck.

You know what, I think we've had all the bad luck we're going to have.

My God. Rachel! Your here. I can't believe it. What happen? Why are you here?

Well I just came... I just needed to tell you... Congratulations.

You really think this is okay?

Well, Ross and Emily aren't gonna use it.

Oh, it's so beautiful. Ohh! Y'know, I-I don't know if I feel right about this.

Oh Mon-Mon-Mon-Mon-look, this is the honeymoon suite. The room expects sex. The room would be disappointed if it didn't get sex. All of the other honeymoon suites would think it was a loser.

Okay!

Okay!

Emily?!

Nope, not under here!

You didn't find her?

No, I've looked everywhere!

Well, you couldn't have looked everywhere or else you would've found her!

Yeah, I think you should keep looking!

Yeah, for about 30 minutes.

Or 45.

Wow, in 45 minutes you can find her twice.

No! For all I know, she's trying to find me but couldn't because I kept moving around. No, from now on, I'm staying in one place. Right here.

Well, it's getting late.

Yeah, we're gonna go.

Actually, do you guys mind staying here for a while?

Ugh, y'know, umm we gotta get up early and catch that plane for New York.

Yeah, it's a very large plane.

That's cool.

But, we'll stay here with you.

Thanks guys! I really appreciate this, y'know, but you don't have to rub my butt.

We have to leave for New York in an hour.

I know, I've been looking at those doors, they look pretty sound proof, don't you think?

We can't do that that's insane. I mean 'A' he could wake up and 'B' y'know, let's go for it.

Em-Emily? Em-Emily? Emily!

No.

You can forget about Emily, she's not with us.

We've come for her things.

Wait, well wh-wh-wh-where is she?

She's in hiding. She's utterly humiliated. She doesn't want to see you ever again.

We're very sad that it didn't work out between you and Emily, monkey. But, I think you're absolutely delicious.

Excuse me, I'm standing right here!

Oh yes, there you are.

Hey-hey, you guys oh hurry up, get some, there's a whole cart outside...

Goodbye Geller.

Now, hold on! Hold on! Look, look, your daughter and I are supposed to leave tonight for our honeymoon, now-now you-you tell her that I'm gonna be at that airport and I hope that she'll be there too! Oh yeah, I said Rachel's name, but it didn't mean anything, Okay? She's-she's just a friend and that's all! That's all! Now just tell Emily that I love her and that I can't imagine spending my life with anyone else. Please, promise me that you'll tell her that.

All right, I'll tell her. Come on bugger face!

Call me.

You spend half your life in the bathroom, why don't you ever go out the bloody window!

Y'know, maybe it's best that we never got to do it again.

Yeah, it kinda makes that-that one night special. Y'know, technically we still are over international waters.

I'm gonna go to the bathroom, maybe I'll see you there in a bit?

'Kay!

Can I ask you something?

Uhh, no.

Felicity and I, we're watching My Giant, and I was thinking, "I'm never gonna be as good an actor as that giant." Do you think I'm just wasting my life with this acting thing?

No.

I mean, the giant is like five years younger than me, y'know, you think I'll ever get there?

Yes.

Thanks man.

Okay man.

But what about how much taller he is than me?

I mean, there's no way I can make myself taller now, y'know? And who knows what science will come up with in the future, but Chandler, what if I die an unsuccessful, regular sized man?

Hey, Monica, wow you've been in the bathroom for like a half-hour.

I know!

Had the beef-tips, huh?

Ahh, yes, I will have a glass of the Merlot

Okay.

And uh, he will have a white wine spritzer.

Okay, good. Thank you. I'll be back shortly, all right?

All right. Woo! Hey, look at that, the airport's moving. Hey, are we moving?! Are we moving? Why are we moving? They said they were gonna wait! Miss? Yeah, does the captain know that we're moving? Oh my... Ross, you better be under the wheels of this thing!!
