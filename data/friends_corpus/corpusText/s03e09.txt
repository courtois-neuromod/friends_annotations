Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Awww!

Hey, it's your Thanksgiving too, y'know, instead of watching football, you could help.

We will.

Okay, Rachel, you wanna put the marshmellows in concentric circles.

No Mon, you want to put them in concentric circles. I want to do this.

Every year.

We should defiantly play football more often. Maybe there's a like league we could join or something.

Isn't there a national football league.

Yes. Yes, there is, they play on Sundays and Monday nights.

Oh shoot! I work Monday nights.

Umm, this stuffing is amazing. Do you think we should bring them some?

When they're hungry enough, they'll come in.

Let go!

No! You let go!

No!

How come it's always us left in the field holding the ball?

I don't know. I guess the other people just don't care enough.

Hey! It's starting to snow.

Gimme the this!

Let go!
