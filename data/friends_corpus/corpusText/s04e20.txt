Look at me! My big concern is what's real?! Oh my God. We're really sad, aren't we?

Yeah, I think we are.

This isn't even my dress.

Well, at least you didn't rent yours from a store called, "It's Not Too Late."

I'm changing out of this.

Me too.

In like a half-hour?

Me too.

Okay, throw it straight this time.

Okay.

I'm getting married next!!

Yay!

I hate my regular clothes now! Y'know? I look down and-and I know that this isn't gonna be the most special day of my life.

Yeah. I mean it was kinda fun for a while, but didn't you start feeling silly?

I guess.

Oh my God!

Oh God.

Oh, you're such a cheater!

Hello! Little ones.

Hey!

Hey!

So, is Joey gonna stop snoring?

Yep! And! A beautiful woman agreed to go out with me. Joey wanted to ask her out, but uh, she picked me.

Oh, how'd that happen?

Because I'm cooler.

No, seriously.

Well she's, she's the kinda girl-Joey was unconscious.

Hey you guys! What's happening?

Oh my God!

What is that?

Oh, they gave it to me at the sleep clinic, and it's gonna help me not to snore.

Well, are you asleep right now, Joe? 'Cause I don't think you have to wear it unless you are!

I know I don't have too! It tastes good.

Plus, you look cool.
