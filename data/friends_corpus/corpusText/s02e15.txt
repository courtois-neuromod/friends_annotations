Alright, no peeking. No peeking, no peeking, no peeking.

Alright, alright, but you better be wearing clothes when I open my eyes.

Alright open your eyes.

Sweet mother of all that is good and pure.

Huh? Days of our Lives picked up my option.

Congratulations!

I know. chandler: Now we can finally watch Green Acres the way it was meant to be seen.

Uh-huh.

Sorry we're late.

Ah, that's OK, come on in. Um, I'm sorry, is Monica Geller coming? I was told she was.

Dr. Burke, it, it's me.

Monica? My God you used to be so. . . I mean you, you, you, you must have lost like. . . You look great.

Thank you. This is my friend Phoebe. She's gonna be helping me tonight.

Hi Phoebe, nice to meet you. So, how ya been?

I've been great, just great. How have you been?

Oh, well obviously you know Barbara and I split up, otherwise you wouldn't have done the head tilt.

The head tilt?

Yeah, since the divorce, when anybody asks me how I am, it's always with a sympathetic head tilt. 'How ya doin'? You OK?'

I'm sorry.

No no, it, it's fine, believe me. I do it too. I always answer with the 'I'm OK' head bob. 'I'm OK.' 'You sure?' 'Yeah, I'm fine.' Hey listen, I've got to set up the music. I got a new CD changer, of course the divorce only left me with 4 CD's to change.

Oh, that's too bad.

I'll survive.

You've got to get back out there, it's your party.

But they're so dull, they're all opthamologists.

You're an opthamologist.

Only because my parents wanted me to be, I wanted to be a sherrif.

That's funny, no. Cadillac, cataract, I get it, no I get it, you stay out there.

See.

Alright, I'll tell you what. I'll come get you in 5 minutes with some sort of um, kabob emergency.

OK. You better. Oh God, here we go. Hey wanna see 'em go nuts? Watch this. Who needs glasses?

You are so smitten.

I am not.

Oh, you are so much the smitten kitten. You should ask him out.

Dr. Burke? I don't think so. I mean, like, he's a grown up.

So. You two are totally into each other.

Phoebe, he's a friend of my parents. He's like 20 years older than me.

OK, so what, you're just never gonna see him again?

Not never. I mean, I'm gonna see him tomorrow at my eye appointment.

Didn't you like, just get your eyes checked?

Well yeah, but, you know, uh, 27 is a dangerous eye age.

Wow, look at that. The car is on fire, yet somehow it's expensive paint job is protected by the Miracle Wax.

You got a Cheeto on your face man.

Hi.

Hey.

What're you doin' here? Aren't you supposed to be out with Rachel?

That was 14 hours ago.

So how'd it go?

Oh. Listen, have you ever been uh, you know, foolin' around with a girl and uh, she started laughin'?

Yeah, but uh, it was 1982 and my flock of seagulls haircut was tickling her chin.

She laughed at you?

Yeah. I don't know, I've been wanting this since like ninth grade typing, ya know. And I just want it to be perfect and right and. . . why isn't that laser beam cutting through the paint?

It's the Miracle Wax.

It certainly is a miracle.

Hi you guys.

Hey.

Hi. Listen, I was um, thinkin' about. . .

Listen can you guys uh, speak up, it's harder for us to hear you when you lower your voice.

OK, listen, I'm sorry about last night and I really want to make it up to you.

No, you, ya know there's no need to make it u. . . how?

Well, I was thinking maybe a um, a romantic dinner with um, candles and wine and then uh, maybe going back to my place for um, dessert.

Humm, that sounds, I don't, perfect.
