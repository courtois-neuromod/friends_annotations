Hey, look at me. I'm making jam, been at it since 4 o'clock this morning.

Where'd you get fruit at four in the morning?

Went down to the docks. Bet ya didn't know you could get it wholesale.

I didn't know there were docks.

Hey.

Hey.

Aww, is it broken?

No, I gotta wear this thing for a couple weeks.

Did you tell the doctor you did it jumping up and down on your bed?

Nooo. I had a story all worked out but then Chandler sold me out.

Well, I'm sorry Joe. I didn't think the doctor was gonna buy that it just *fell* out of the socket.

What is this? Fruit?

Monica's making jam.

Whoa, jam! I love jam! Hey, how come we never have jam at our place?

Because the kids need new shoes.

I'm going into business people. I'm sick and tired of being depressed about Richard. I needed a plan, a plan to get over my man. What's the opposite of man? Jam. Oh Joey don't! It's way to hot.

This will just be my batch.

Um, that's it. No. Hey! You! J. Crew guy. Yeah. Why have you been following me? I mean, all week long everywhere I look there's you.

You wouldn't return my calls, you sent back my letters....

What?

One more chance Ursula, please?

Oooh. Oh, well this is awkward.

Wh..

Um, yeah, you want Ursula, and I'm Phoebe. Twin sisters! Seriously.

Oh, that's great. I'm stalking the wrong woman. I am such a dingus!

Oh, you're not a dingus.

I just, I want you to know I didn't used to be like this. Before I meet your sister I was like this normal guy who sold beepers and cellular phones.

Well, I mean look it's, it's not your fault, you know. I mean this is just what, what she does to guys, okay.

Well thanks.

Wait, you know what, I got a little story. When I was in Junior High School I went through this period where I thought I was a witch. And there was this guidance counselor who said something to me, that I think will help you a lot. He said okay, 'you're not a witch you're just an average student.' See what I'm saying?

Not really.

Um, well, get over it. So, I mean you, you just seem to be a really nice guy, you know. Don't be so hard on yourself okay.

Wait. You're right. I know you're right. And, thanks for being so nice. Here

Oh, thanks a lot. Do you want to get a cup of coffee?

Yeah, okay.

Okay. Okay, you don't have to walk behind me any more.

Sorry.

Here's my binoculars.

Oh, great. Great. You're doing great, you know real strong. Going strong. Keep going.

These are my night vision goggles. This is the book I pretend to read when I'm watching her in the park. And these are Mad Lips, they're just for fun.

Oh, yeah. What's this?

Oh, this is log I kept, recording her every movement. Do you wanna here something from it?

Um, not even a little bit.

It's about you.

Oh, okay then.

I met Phoebe today. She was really nice to me eventhough I'm such a loser. And, then when I was walking home I thought about her a lot, it was weird, but kinda cool.

Good. So what were you thinking?

I was thinking what it would be like to kiss you.

Really?

No.

Oh.

See that's just something I said now, so that maybe I could kiss you.

Oh, okay.

Oh my God, what happened?

Oh. God, crazy Chandler. He spun me...off...the...bed!

Wow! Spinning that sounds like fun.

Oh, I wish. No, you know he was just trying Ross's Hug and Roll thing.

Ross's what?

You know what, where he hugs you and kinda rolls you away and... Oh... my....God.

Phoebe?

Yes? Yes! Oh.

What are you doing?

Oh, I was just here looking for, um, my um, my part of an old sandwich. Oh, here it is! Oh.

Were you following me?

Um, perhaps. Yes! Yes, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I was just afraid that you were still hung up on my sister.

So you spied on me. I can't believe you don't trust me.

Oh well, what do you know, there goes my identical twin sister. Just walkin' along looking like me. What, is this just like a freakish coincidence, or did you know she takes this train?

I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I tried to stop, but I couldn't. I'm so pathetic.

No, no, it's not your fault. You know it's partly my fault, 'cause I made you quit cold turkey. Sorry, no. Okay, well, I mean, I can't date you anymore, 'cause your, you know Wow! But um, but I will definitely, definitely help you get over my sister. Okay, stalk me for a while. Huh? Yeah, and, and, and, I'll be like an Ursula patch.

Uh-huh, I don't know.

Yeah, just, okay, look I'm going. Um, come on. Op, op, behind the pillar, which way am I gonna go?

I called the sperm bank today, they haven't sold a single unit of Tribianni. Nobody wants my product. I mean, I-I-I don't get it Maybe if they met me in person.

Honey, you got a little thing on your...

Did I get it?

Yeah.

Hello.

Hello.

Hey. Uh, Chan, can I uh, can I talk to you for a second?

Sure. What's up?

Just one uh, one additional relationship thought. Probably something your already familiar with, uh, women talk!
