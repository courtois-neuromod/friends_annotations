Terry, I, I, I know that I haven't worked here very long, but I was wondering, do you think it would be possible if I got a $100 advance in my salary?

An advance?

It's so that I can spend Thanksgiving with my family. See, every year we go skiing in Vail, and normally my father pays for my ticket, but I sort of started the whole independence thing, you know, which is actually why I took this job.

Rachel, Rachel, sweetheart. You're a terrible, terrible waitress. Really, really awful.

Ok, I, I hear what you're sayin'. I'm with you. Um, but I, but I'm trying really hard. And I think I'm doing better. I really do. Does anybody need coffee? Oh, look at that.

Hi, is uh, is Carol here?

No, she's at a faculty meeting.

Oh, I uh, just came by to pick up my skull. Well, not mine, but...Susan: Come in.

Thanks. Yeah, Carol borrowed it for a class, and I have to get it back to the museum.

What's it look like?

Kinda like a big face without skin.

Yes, I'm familiar with the concept. We can just look for it.

Ok. Wow, you guys sure have a lot of books about bein' a lesbian.

Well, you know, you have to take a course. Otherwise, they don't let you do it.

Hey, hey, Yertle the Turtle. A classic.

Actually, I'm reading it to the baby.

The uh, the baby that hasn't been born yet? Wouldn't that mean you're... crazy?

What, you don't think they can hear sounds in there?

You're not serious, I mean, you really... you really talk to it?

Yeah, all the time. I want the baby to know my voice.

Do you uh, do you talk about me?

Yeah, yeah, all the time.

Really?

But um, we just refer to you as Bobo the Sperm Guy.

Look, if she's talking to it, I just think that I should get some belly time too. Not that I believe any of this.

Oh, I believe it. I think the baby can totally hear everything. I can show you. Look, this will seem a little weird, but you put your head inside this turkey, and then we'll all talk, and you'll hear everything we say.

I'd just like to say that I'm totally behind this experiment. In fact, I'd very much like to butter your head.

Hey, Rach, did you make your money?

No, not even close. Forget Vail, forget seeing my family, forget shoop, shoop, shoop.

Rach, here's your mail.

Thanks, you can just put it on the table.

No, here's your mail.

Thanks, you can just put it on the table.

Would you just open it?

Oh my god, oh, you guys are great.

We all chipped in.

We did?

You owe me 20 bucks.

Thank you. Thank you so much!

Chandler, here you go, got your traditional Thanksgiving feast, you got your tomato soup, your grilled cheese fixin's, and your family size bag of Funyuns.

Wait, wait, Chandler, this is what you're havin' for Thanksgiving dinner? What, what, what is it with you and this holiday?

All right, I'm nine years old.

Oh, I hate this story.

We just finished this magnificent Thanksgiving dinner. I have--and I remember this part vividly--a mouthful of pumpkin pie, and this is the moment my parents choose to tell me they're getting divorced.

Oh my god.

Yes. It's very difficult to appreciate a Thanksgiving dinner once you've seen it in reverse.

Uh, hi. We uh, we used to work together.

We did?

Yeah, at Macy's. You were the Obsession girl, right? I was the Aramis guy. Aramis? Aramis?

Yeah, right.

I gotta tell you. You're the best in the business.

Get out.

I'm serious. You're amazing. You know when to spritz, when to lay back.

Really? You don't know what that means to me.

Ooh, you smell great tonight. What're you wearing?

Nothing.

Listen, uh, you wanna go get a drink or something?

Yeah. Oh.

What's wrong?

I just remembered, I have to do something.

Oh. What?

Um, leave.

Wait, wait, wait!

Anytime you're ready.

Ok, ok, here we go. Ok, where am I talking to, here? I mean, uh, well, there is one way that seems to offer a certain acoustical advantage, but...

Just aim for the bump.

Ok, ok, ok, ok, here goes. You know, I, you know, can't do this. Uh, this is too weird. I feel stupid.

So don't do it, it's fine. You don't have to do it just because Susan does it.

Hello, baby. Hello, hello.

I loved the moment when you first saw the giant dog shadow all over the park.

Yeah, but did they have to shoot him down? I mean, that was just mean.

Ok, right about now the turkey should be crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside. Why are we standing here?

We're waiting for you to open the door. You got the keys.

No I don't.

Yes, you do. When we left, you said, "got the keys."

No I didn't. I asked, "got the ke-eys?"

No, no, no, you said, "got the keys".

Do either of you have the keys?

The oven is on.

Oh, I gotta get my ticket!

Wait, wait, we have a copy of your key.

Well then get it, get it!

That tone will not make me go any faster.

Joey!

That one will.

And everyone's telling me, you gotta pick a major, you gotta pick a major. So, on a dare, I picked paleontology. And you have no idea what I'm saying, because, let's face it, you're a fetus. You're just happy you don't have gills anymore.

Look, you don't have to talk to it. You can sing to it if you want.

Oh, please. I am not singing to your stomach, ok?

Hi, how's it goin?

Shh! Here we come, walkin' down the street, get the funniest looks from, everyone we meet. Hey, hey! Hey, uh, did you just feel that?

I did.

Does it always, uh--?

No, no that was the first.

Keep singing! Keep singing!

Hey, hey, you're my baby, and I can't wait to meet you. When you come out I'll buy you a bagel, and then we'll go to the zoo.

I felt it!

Hey, hey, I'm your daddy. I'm the one without any breasts.
