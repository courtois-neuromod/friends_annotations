Hey, wouldn't be cool if our duck and chick had a little baby? We could call it Chuck.

Or... Dick.

Hey.

Hey.

Listen, I-I need a favor. Umm, I was in the shower, and as I was cleansing myself, I ah, I-I, well I felt something.

Was it like a sneeze only better?

No, no, I mean, I mean a thing on my body.

What was it?

Well, I don't know, it's-it's kinda in a place that's not... It's not visually accessible to me, and I was hoping maybe you guys could-could help me out.

Whoa!!!

No!!

Come on you guys, it's no big deal!

Whoa-heeeiiiiii-iiiii-ah!! Huh.

Well what is it? Is it a mole?

No, it's too wrinkly to be a mole.

Well, eww. What? Is it a pimple?

No, it's... fancier than a pimple. Look Ross, why don't you just go see a...

Hey guys! What's...

Okay, well, it's definite, two more weeks of winter.

Ahhh.

Yeah, right.

...and I know I'll never miss doing it, but I gotta tell you, it's pretty cool knowing that you're making a difference in a kid's life.

That is so great! Oh, I... Oh my God!

Whoa!

Oh my God!!!

Ahh-ahh, we'd better call the fire department!

No! No!

No, no?

Well, we don't n-n-n-n-need a fireman, we'd, we'd like a good mechanic. Oh my God, here they come! Well, we gotta get out of here!

W-w-w-wait! Why?!

Well look, if I wanted to see a fireman, I would date one. Okay?

Th-th-that's all it is, a third nipple. Y'know? Just your run-of-the-mill third nipple. Y'know? You can take it off. Just slice that baby right off!

Take your shirt off, and let's see what we're dealing with here. What are you doing?

Just showing you my run-of-the-mill-slice-it-right-off third nipple.

Well that's not a third nipple.

No?

First of all, it's on your ass.

Well then, what is it?!

Wait a minute, hold it. Johnson! Will you come in here a moment?

I'm with Hamilton!

He's good with rear things, bring him in too.

I gotta go water Pete's plants. Y'know what, if he's gonna break up with me, maybe I won't water his plants.

Well, if he's gonna break up with you, maybe Joey and I should water his plants. If y'know what I mean.

Or ha-ha, we could go over there and pee on them.

...and I-I can't take it! Y'know? I'm just, always afraid one of them is gonna catch me with the other one. It's making me crazy.

Well honey, then why don't you break up with one of them?

Uh.

Whoa-whoa-whoa. What ah, what happened to playing the field?

Well, it just, it doesn't feel like playing anymore, it feels like work. It's like I'm working in the field.

So Pheebs, pick one of them.

Yeah. Which one do you like more?

Well, Vince is great, y'know `cause, he's like a guy, guy. Y'know? He's so burly, he's sooo very burly.

Okay, good, so there you go. Go with Vince.

Yeah, but Jason's really sensitive.

Well sensitive is important, pick him.

Yeah.

Oh sure, go with the sissy.

Jason is not a sissy!

Oh no-no-no-no, I meant Chandler.

Mon you definitely have to make it a theme wedding, and the theme could be, "Look how much money we've got!" Y'know, I mean you could put, you could put money in-in the invitations! You-you could have like little money place settings. And ah, you could start with a money salad! I mean it'll be dry, but people will like it.

Would you stop? We've only been going out a couple of weeks, I mean we don't even know if he's gonna propose.

Yes, but this is Pete. Okay? He's not like other people, on your first date he took you to Rome. For most guys that's like a third or fourth date kinda thing.

Well if-if that's what it is, then it's-it's crazy.

Monica's right. We're talking about getting married here. Okay? She-she can't just rush into this.

Oh please, what do you know! You married a lesbian!

All right. I gotta go. I have break up with Vince.

Oh, so you're going with the teacher, huh?

Yeah, I like Vince a lot, y'know? But, it's just Jason's so sensitive, y'know? And in the long run, I think sensitive it's just better than having just like a really, really, really nice butt. Jason! Definitely Jason! Okay, wish me luck!

Good luck!

OH MY GOD!!! Sorry, I was just imagining what it'd be like to catch the money bouquet.

Excuse me. Umm, is Vince here?

Oh sure. Vince?!

Yo!!

Wow! I didn't know you guys actually used those.

So, what's up?

Umm, wow. This-this isn't gonna be easy. Umm, I don't think we should see each other anymore.

Uh-huh. G-good deal.

I'm sorry.

No-no it's okay. It's just that ah, I thought we had something pretty special here. And y'know I-I felt like you were someone I could finally open up to, and... That there's so much in me I have to share with you yet.

Oh my God, I didn't...

I'm sorry, I can't talk. I'm gonna go write in my journal.

Wait-wait-wait! Wait!!

I'm telling you, if you want to take care of that thing, you should go to my herbal guy.

Thank you, but I want to remove it Pheebs. I don't want to make it savory.

Y'know when girls sleep with guys with weird things on their body, they tell their friends about it.

Gimme this.

Hi! Okay, don't be mad at me, but I couldn't resist.

Brides magazines?

Yes, and I know that you'd say no if he asked you, but I'm sorry; how great would you look walking down the aisle in this Donna Carin.

Oh, you so would! Oh, you should get that anyway. Like for clubbing.

It is so weird, I know what I said, but uh, this morning, I was lying in bed I was, I was imagining what it would be like to say yes. I know it's a little sudden, and it's a little rushed, and it's totally not like me to do something like this, but that doesn't mean I can't. Right? I mean I'm-I'm crazy about Pete, and I know that we want the same things, and when I thought about saying yes, it made me really happy.

Oh my God.

I know. I need more pie.

Hey Mon umm, if you do get married, can I bring two guests?

You didn't break up with that fireman?

No, that was my way of telling you. Well, it turns out he's incredibly sensitive, he keeps a journal and he paints. He even showed me charcoal drawings that he drew of me.

Wow!

Yeah, well he'd prefer water colors, but y'know, he has easy access to a lot of charcoal.

So then, are you going to dump Jason?

Well, yeah, because I have to break up with someone, and... Okay so Jason is sensitive, but now so's Vince Plus, Vince has the body y'know? So... It's really just about the math.

You must be Ross.

Hi.

I am Guru Saj.

Listen, I got to tell you I've-I've never been to a guru before, so...

Well, relax. If it makes you feel better, I've attended some of the finest medical schools in Central America. Well then, let's take a look at this skin abnormality of yours. Come on, have a seat. Eeh, huh. As I suspected, it's a koondis!

What's a koondis?

I don't know, what's a koondis with you? Please, lie down! I've got a sav that oughta shrink that right up.

I guess it's worth a try.

Oh sure, we should see results-Whoa!! Clearly not the way to go!!

What?! What?!

We appear to have angered it.

We?! We angered it?!

Oh, I think I see the problem. And I'm afraid we're gonna have to use a much stronger tool. Love.

Oh God!

Ross, there is absolutely no way this is going to come off unless you start to...

Ow!!

Oops.

What was, what was that?

Well it's gone.

What?! How's that?

It got caught on my watch.

Hey!

Lights. Uh, romantic lights.

Ooh, nice.

So ah, there was this thing I wanted to talk to you about.

Oh, right! I completely forgot about that.

Well ah, I've been doing a lot of thinking, and I look at my life...

Yeah?

And I feel like I've conquered the business world, and I feel like I've conquered the intellectual world, and now I-I have the most beautiful woman in the world.

Wow.

There's one thing missing.

What's that?

It's time for me to conquer the physical world.

Okay.

Monica, I want to become the Ultimate Fighting Champion.

You wanna what?!

I want to become the Ultimate Fighting Champion! It's the most intense physical competition in the world, it's banned in 49 states!

What are you talking about?

Okay, my trainer, Ho Chi, is teaching me a combination of Gee Koon Doe and Brazilian street fighting, I've even had my own octagon training ring designed.

And I suppose you used a ring designer for that.

Yeah. Monica, I want you there in the front row when I win. I want you close enough to smell the blood. What do you think?

My parents will be so happy.

"Crazy underwear, creepin' up my butt. Crazy underwear, always in a rut. Crazy under--wear..." Oh No! What is he doing here? All right, just keep playing, just keep playing. You'll get through this; you'll be fine. Okay, thank you. And, as always no one talk to me after the show.

Hey. I was...

Hey!

I was passin' by and I saw that you were playing tonight, it's kinda cool seeing you up there.

Whoa! Hey-hey! What's going on here? Who is this guy?

I don't know, he just started kissing me. Get him! Get him, Vince!

What?!

What?!

Yeah, okay, I've-I've been dating both of you, and it's been really horrible. 'Cause y'know it's been a lot of fun, for me. Umm, but I-I like you both, and I, and I didn't know how to chose, so... I'm sorry, I'm just, I'm terrible, I'm a terrible person. I'm terrible.

Phoebe, Phoebe relax, it's okay. I mean we never said this was exclusive.

Yeah, and neither did we. Give yourself a break.

Really?!

Yeah. I mean y'know, we haven't been going out that long. Come on, we haven't even slept together yet. Huh.

You haven't?

You have?

Well, this is none of my business.

I-I can't believe this! You-you've slept with him?!

Well, I made you a candle light dinner in the park.

Y'know Phoebe, I'm gonna make this real easy for you.

Well, that could've been really awkward.

You made him a candle light dinner in the park?

Yeah, but I-I-I-I can do that for you, I'm gonna do that for you.

Uh yeah, I can't believe I ever went out with somebody who would actually have an open flame in the middle of a wooden area.
