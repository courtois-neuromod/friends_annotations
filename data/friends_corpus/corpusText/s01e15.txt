Coffee.

Thank you.

Cappuccino.

Grazie.

And a nice hot cider for Monica.

Aww, thank you. Uh Rach?

Yeah?

Why does my cinamon stick have an eraser?

Oh! That's why. I'm sorry!

OK, try this salmon mousse.

Mmmm. Good.

Is it better than the other salmon mousse?

It's creamier.

Yeah, well, is that better?

I don't know. We're talking about whipped fish, Monica. I'm just happy I'm keeping it down, y'know?

My God! What happened to you?

Eight and a half hours of aptitude tests, intelligence tests, personality tests... and what do I learn? "You are ideally suited for a career in data processing for a large multinational corporation."

That's so great! 'Cause you already know how to do that!

Can you believe it? I mean, don't I seem like somebody who should be doing something really cool? You know, I just always pictured myself doing something...something.

Oh Chandler, I know, I know... oh, hey! You can see your nipples through this shirt!

Here you go, maybe this'll cheer you up.

Ooh, you know, I had a grape about five hours ago, so I'd better split this with you.

It's supposed to be that small. It's a pre-appetizer. The French call it an amouz-bouche.

Well.... it is amouz-ing...

Hello? Oh, hi Wendy! Yeah, eight o'clock. What did we say? Ten dollars an hour?... OK, great. All right, I'll see you then. Bye.

Ten dollars an hour for what?

Oh, I asked one of the waitresses at work if she'd help me out.

Waitressing?

Uh-oh.

Well... of course I thought of you! But... but...

But, but?

But, you see, it's just... this night has to go just perfect, you know? And, well, Wendy's more of a... professional waitress.

Oh! I see. And I've sort of been maintaining my amateur status so that I can waitress in the Olympics.

You know, I don't mean to brag, but I waited tables at Innsbruck in '76. Amouz-bouche?

Talk to me.

OK.... um, a weird thing happened to me on the train this morning...

No no no. Talk... dirty.

Wha... what, here?

Yes...

Ah....

Say something..... hot.

Er.... um.....

What?

Um... uh.... vulva.

Well?

Wow! It's huge! It's so much bigger than the cubicle. Oh, this is a cube.

Look at this!

Oh! You have a window!

Yes indeedy! With a beautiful view of...

Oh look! That guy's peeing!

OK, that's enough of the view. Check this out, look at this. Sit down, sit down.

OK.

This is great! Helen, could you come in here for a moment?

Thank you Helen, that'll be all.

Last time I do that, I promise.

Wendy, we had a deal! Yeah, you promised! Wendy! Wendy! Wendy!

Who was that?

Wendy bailed. I have no waitress.

Oh... that's too bad. Bye bye.

Ten dollars an hour.

No.

Twelve dollars an hour.

Mon. I wish I could, but I've made plans to walk around.

You know, Rachel, when you ran out of your wedding, I was there for you. I put a roof over your head, and if that means nothing to you... twenty dollars an hour.

Done.

What a tool!

You don't want to work for a guy like that.

Yeah!

I know... it's just... I thought this was, you know... it.

Look, you'll get there. You're an amazing chef.

Yeah! You know all those yummy noises? I wasn't faking.

So, er... how did it go with Celia?

Oh, I was unbelievable.

All right, Ross!

I was the James Michener of dirty talk. It was the most elaborate filth you have ever heard. I mean, there were characters, plot lines, themes, a motif... at one point there were villagers.

Whoa! And the... huh-huh?

Well, ahem... you know, by the time we'd finished with all the dirty talk, it was kinda late... and we were both kind of exhausted, so uh...

You cuddled.

Yeah, which was nice.

You guys wanna try and catch a late movie or something?

Maybe, but shouldn't we wait for Chandler?

Yeah, where the hell is he?

How's this?

Eeeee!

Sorry. How about over here?

Aaaaah!

See, that just means it's working. Does this hurt?

No.

What about this?

Aaaaahhh!!

There you go!
