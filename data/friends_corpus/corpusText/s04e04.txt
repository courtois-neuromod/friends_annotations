Hey! New wallet, huh?

Yeah, it was time. The old condom ring in the leather just doesn't say 'cool' anymore.

Rachel!

What?

You just put an empty carton back in the fridge!

Oh yeah, I know, but the garbage was full.

Have you ever taken out the trash?

Well, I thought you liked doing it.

Third door on the left.

Right!

Oh! Hey, Mr. Treeger.

Hey.

What are you doing?

Ummm. Oh! I'm sorry. It's a little old but...

No! You're clogging up the chute that I spent a half-hour unclogging!

I'm sorry. I didn't-I don't come in here a lot.

Oh yeah, of course you don't!

No.

'Cause you're a little princess! "Daddy, buy me a pizza. Daddy, buy me a candy factory. Daddy, make the cast of Cats sing Happy Birthday to me..."

I didn't... I never said that.

You think you could make a mess and the big man in coveralls will come in here and clean it up, huh? Well, why don't think of someone else for a change?

Okay, I'm sorry.

God! If you're gonna cry about it!

Whoa-whoa, Treeger made you cry?

Yes! And he said really mean things that were only partly true.

I'm gonna go down there and teach that guy a lesson.

Joey, please don't do that. I think it's best that we just forget about it.

That's easy for you to say, you weren't almost just killed.

All right that's it, school is in session!

My God! Is this a gym card?

Oh yeah, gym member. I try to go four times a week, but I've missed the last 1200 times.

So why don't you quit?

You don't think I've tried? You think I like having 50 dollars taken out of my bank account every month? No, they make you go all the way down there! Then they use all of these phrases and peppiness to try and confuse you! Then they bring out Maria.

Who is Maria?

Oh Maria. You can't say no to her, she's like this lycra spandex covered gym...treat.

You need me to go down there with you and hold your hand?

No!

So you're strong enough to face her on your own?

Oh no, you'll have to come.

Tribbiani! Hold on, I'll get the plunger.

Hey! You hold on pal! Now you made my friend, Rachel, cry. So now, you're gonna go up there and apologize to her, unless you want me to call the landlord.

And tell him what?

Have you heard about a little something called, Not Making Girls Cry.

Yeah. Well maybe you have heard about the Rent Stabilization Act of 1968!

I have actually not heard of that.

Yeah, well your friends are in violation of it. I've been a nice guy up until now, but uh, I don't need this grief. I'm gonna call the landlord and tell him that Monica is illegally subletting here grandmother's apartment. Your friends are outta here pal.

Why don't you tell me something I don't know!

Whoa-whoa-whoa, hey! Now remember what we talked about, you gotta be strong.

Yes. Yes!

One more time, "Hey, don't you want a washboard stomach and rock hard pecs?"

No! I want a flabby gut and saggy man breasts!

Good! That's good!

Okay. I wanna quit the gym.

You wanna quit?

I wanna quit the gym.

You do realize that you won't have access to our new full service Swedish spa.

I wanna quit the gym.

Okay, Dave in the membership office, handles quitters. Uh, excuse me, are you a member?

Me? No.

Sorry, members only.

I wanna quit the gym.

It's okay man, be strong.

So, are you a member of any gym.

No! And I'm not gonna be, so you can save you little speech.

Okay, no problem. Could you come here for a second?

Hi, I'm Maria.

Wow, you have really pretty feet.

These old things.

Would you mind spending some time on my siadic area, it's been killing me today.

You mean the-Okay by siadic, you mean the towel covered portion.

Yeah.

Sure, yeah, no I can do that, yeah, because umm, y'know, the muscles in the siadic area can get y'know, real nice and tight. So umm, tell me Rick, how umm, how did you injure the area.

Oh, a 16-hour sit-in for Greenpeace.

Oh.

Ow! Did you just bite me?

No!

What?

Please don't kick Monica and Rachel out, this wasn't there fault, it was mine.

You want me to kick you guys out instead?

No you can't do that, where would the chick and the duck live?

You have pets!

Noo-no-no, no, those are nicknames. I'm the chick and Chandler is the duck.

Huh, I would've thought it was the other way around.

Come on man, just-just let the girls stay, I'll do whatever you want.

Really? You'll do anything?

Yeah-yeah, absolutely.

Yeah, I've got something you can do.

What, what is it?

Can you be my dancing partner?

That's not, prison lingo, is it?

All right, I'm here, let's ahh, get this over with.

Okay ahh, well, just ahh, follow my lead.

Whoa-whoa, don't we need to do some kinda preparation first? Like ahh, get really drunk?

Look come on, eh, just ah, just ah, put your arms around me, eh.

Ahhhh! I'm sorry!

No, it's okay, but if I'm Marge, my breasts are coming out my back.

Ahh, forget it! I'll never be any good at this, my mom was right, I'm just a big potato with arms, and legs, and a head.

Come on man, you're not a potato.

I'm sure as hell a dancer, it's no use Marge will never go for me.

Come on Treeger, don't say that. You just ahh, you just need more practice. Here, come on, let's ahh, let's try it again. Come on. Plus, it was, it was probably mostly my fault, anyway. I mean, y'know, I'm not really that comfortable dancing with a- We-he!! Hey!

Yeah!

Hey-hey, how goes the dancing? Gay yet?

Ah-ha-ha, you guys owe me big time.

What was that?

What?

You just did a little dancy thing.

No I didn't.

Yes you did! You did like a little hop.

You are soo enjoying this.

No, I'm not! And it wasn't a hop it was a pademarie.

You know the words! You are so into this!

All right, well maybe I'm enjoying it a little bit. I mean I'm getting pretty good at it.

Ooh, this is soo sweet, Joey our little twinkle-toes.

Hey-hey, hold on, this isn't some kind of like girly dance. All right, it's like a sport, it's manly!

All right, then show me some manly moves.

All right.

I don't know how to lead.

Hello.

Hi.

We'd like to close our accounts.

Close your accounts? Is there some kind of problem?

No-no.

No, we'd just like to close them.

Okay, Ms. Lambert handles all our closures. Would you come over here please?

Hi, I'm Karen.

I wanna quit the bank!

Okay, baseball. Rick, playing baseball. Okay, slides into second, maybe even his pants come down a little... Oh no-wait no, no! No! Okay, all right, sandwiches, sandwiches. Umm, okay, on a plate, maybe Rick's pants come down a little. No! No! Okay, Chandler! Okay Chandler, ooh, that's working.

Chandler's knees. Chandler's... ankles. Chandler's ankle hair. Oh no. Okay, you're all set.

Oh wow! That was amazing, was that really just an hour?!

Yeah! In... really long hour world.

What?

Ugh, okay, I have an enormous crush on you. But because you're a client, I can't ask you out, even though you give me y'know, the feeling.

Wow! I had no idea! But you know, I could always find another masseuse.

Really?!

Yeah, really.

What?

Suddenly, I very aware that I'm naked.

Okay, quit down.

Mr. Simon's been waiting for- Oh my God!

Why wasn't I offered that? I'd definitely pay more for that.

Phoebe, we have rules here, this isn't that kind of place.

Oh yeah, oh and I know, but this isn't what it looks like, 'cause Rick is my ahh, husband.

Oh really? Well, then you'd better tell his other wife, 'cause she called three times asking where he is.

Yes, I will tell her.
