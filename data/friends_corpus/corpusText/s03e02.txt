All right they got water, orange juice, and what looks like cider.

Taste it.

Yep, it's fat. I drank fat!

Yeah, I know, I did that two minutes ago.

Hey!

Hey, mister tux!

Why aren't you guys dressed?

We have a half hour.

No, four minutes ago you had a half hour, we have to be out the door at twenty to eight.

Relax Ross, we'll be ready. It only takes us two minutes to get dressed.

Well, you know, I'd feel a whole lot better if you got dressed now.

Okay.

Hey-hey! Oh, look at you, all sexy.

Really.

Ooooh! Wow!! Oh, hi.

Hi.

How come you didn't come over earlier?

'Cause, I'm a stupid, stupid man.

Hey, Ross, want some cider?

No. So, um, let's see your pretty close, huh. Make-up's on, hair's done.

Yeah, I just have to get dressed.

Yay! And that takes what? Just six or seven minutes.

Yeah! Once, I figure out what I'm wearing.

Glass of fat?

Dr. Geller, Sherman Whitfield, London Institute.

Wow! What a pleasure.

Well, I have to tell you, I was quite impressed with your paper on Pre-Cretaceous fossils. Yeah, it confirmed everything that I have written.

Excuse me. Hi.

Yes?

Well, your kind of sitting in my seat.

What do you mean, your seat?

I mean, I was sitting there.

But, you got up!

But, I never left the room!

But, you left the chair area.

All right, that's it, give me your underwear.
