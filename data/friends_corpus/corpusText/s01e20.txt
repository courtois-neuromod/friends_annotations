I can't believe you would actually say that. I would much rather be Mr. Peanut than Mr. Salty.

No way! Mr.Salty is a sailor, all right, he's got to be, like, thetoughest snack there is.

I don't know, you don't wanna mess with corn nuts. They're craaazy.

Oh my God. You guys! You gotta come see this! There's some creep out there with a telescope!

I can't believe it! He's looking right at us!

Oh, that is so sick.

I feel violated. And not in a good way.

How can people do that?... Oh, you guys, look! Ugly Naked Guy got gravity boots!

Wow... Wow!

Yeah.

I'm not crazy, right? I mean, it was never like that.

Nooo, it wasn't.

Ooh, and it's so nice having this little sink here...

Oh, Danielle! I wasn't expecting the machine... Give me a call when you get a chance. Bye-bye. Oh God!

That's what you've been working on for the past two hours?!

Hey, I've been honing!

What was with the dishes?

Oh, uh.. I want her to think I might be in a restaurant.. y'know? I might have some kind of life, like I haven't been sitting around here honing for the past few hours.

Look look! He's doing it again, the guy with the telescope!

Oh my God! Go away! Stop looking in here!

Great, now he's waving back.

Man, we gotta do something about that guy. This morning, I caught him looking into our apartment. It creeps me out! I feel like I can't do stuff!

What kinda stuff?

Will you grow up? I'm not talking about sexy stuff, but, like, when I'm cooking naked.

You cook naked?

Yeah, toast, oatmeal... nothing that spatters.

What are you looking at me for? I didn't know that.

What's the matter?

Oh, it's just... Oh, Barry, this was not good.

No, it was. It was very very good.

Well, what about Mindy?

Oh, way, way better than Mindy.

No, not that, I mean, what about you and Mindy?

Well, if you want, I'll justI'll just break it off with her.

No. No-no-no-no, no. I mean, don't do that. Not, I mean not for me.

Dr. Farber, Bobby Rush is here for his adjustment.

Thanks, Bernice. Let's go away this weekend.

Oh, Barry..! Come on, this is all way too..

We can, we can go to Aruba! When I went there on what would have been our honeymoon, it was, uh... it was really nice. You would've liked it.

I had a bra.

Hey, Dr. Farber.

All right Miss Green, everything looks fine... Yep, I think we're starting to see some real progress here.

What?!

I'm twelve, I'm not stupid.

Brrrrrrr!

Hell is filled with people like you.

He's back! The peeper's back!

Get down!

Get down?

...And boogie!

Thanks, but I gotta go to work and get my eyes scratched out by Mindy.

Relax. Y'know, she may not even know.

Please. I haven't heard from her in seven months, and now she calls me? I mean, what else is it about? Oh! She was my best friend, you guys! We went to camp together... she taught me how to kiss..

Yeah?

And now, y'know, I'm like... I'm like the other woman! I feel so..

..Naughty!

Right, I'll see you guys later...

Oh, hold up, I'll walk out with you. Now, Rach, when she taught you to kiss, you were at camp, and.. were you wearing any kinda little uniform, or- That's fine, yeah...

Okay, I'm gonna go to the bathroom. Will you watch my phone?

Why don't you just take it with you?

Hey, we haven't been on a second date, she needs to hear me pee?

Why don't you just call her?

I can't call her, I left a message! I have some pride.

Do you?

No! Danielle, hi! It's, uh, it's Chandler! I'm fine. Uh, listen, I don't know if you tried to call me, because, uh, idiot that I am, I accidentally shut off my phone. Oh, uh, okay, that's fine, that's great. Okay. She's on the other line, she's gonna call me back. She's on the other line, she's gonna call me back, she's on the other line, gonna call me back...

Don't you have to pee?

'S'why I'm dancing...

Four letters: "Circle or hoop".

Ring dammit, ring!

Thanks.

Hey, you know our phone's not working?

What?!

I tried to call you from the coffee shop, and there was no answer.

I turned it off. Mother of God, I turned it off!

Just like you told her you did! ... Just pointing out the irony.

Hey, so listen, I went across the street and talked to the doorman- I got the peeper's name! Can I use the phone?

Nngghhh!!!!!!!

Can I use your phone? Yeah, the number for a Sidney Marks, please.

"Heating device."

Radiator.

Five letters.

Rdtor.

Yeah, is Sidney there? Oh, this is? Sidney's a woman.

So she's a woman! So what?

Yeah. Yeah, so what? Look, I live across the street, and I know all about you and your little telescope, and I don't appreciate it, okay? Yeah, I can see you right now! Hello! If I wanna walk around my apartment in my underwear, I shouldn't have to feel like Thank you, but... that's not really the point... The point is that... Mostly free weights, but occasionally..

Joey!!

Yeah, my neighbor... Yeah, the brunette... She says you looked very pretty the other day in the green dress.

The green dress? Really?

Yeah, she said you looked like Ingrid Bergman that day.

Nooo!

You okay?

Yeah.

Really?

Yeah! Y'know, ever since I ran out on Barry at the wedding, I have wondered whether I made the right choice. And now I know.

Aww...

Big day.

All right, I'll give you this, Mr. Peanut is a better dresser. I mean he's got the monocle, he's got the top hat...

You know he's gay?

I just wanna clarify this: are you outing Mr. Peanut?

Chandler?

Danielle! Hi! Uh- everybody, this is Danielle, Danielle, everybody.

Hi. Hi.

What are you doing here?

Well, I've been calling you, but it turns out I had your number wrong. And when I finally got the right one from Information, there was no answer. So I thought I'd just come down here, and make sure you were okay.

...I'm, I'm okay.

Listen uh, maybe we could get together later?

That sounds good. I'll call you- or you call me, whatever...

You got it.

Okay.

G'bye, everybody.

Bye.

Whoo-hoo!

Yeah, there you go!

Second date!

...I dunno.

You don't know?!

Well, she seems very nice and everything, but that whole thing about her coming all the way down here, just to see if I was okay? I mean,... how needy is that?
