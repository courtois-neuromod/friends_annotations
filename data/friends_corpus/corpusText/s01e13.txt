That is it! You just barge in here, you don't knock

I'm sorry!

You have no respect for anybody's privacy!

Rachel, wait, wait.

No, you wait! This is ridiculous!

Can I just say one thing?

What? What?!

That's a relatively open weave and I can still see your... nipular areas.

Oh!!

Gotta go. I miss you too, I love you, but it's getting real late now

Hey Ma. Listen, I made the appointment with Dr. Bazida, and... Excuse me? Did you know this isn't Ma?

Her name's Ronni. She's a pet mortician.

Sure. So how long you been...

Remember when you were a little kid, I used to take you to the navy yard and show you the big ships?

Since then?!

No, it's only been six years. I just wanted to put a nice memory in your head so you'd know that I wasn't always such a terrible guy. ...Joe. Y'ever been in love?

...I d'know.

Then y'haven't. You're burning your tomatoes.

You're one to talk.

Joe, your dad's in love big time. And the worst part of it is, it's with two different women.

Oh man. Please tell me one of 'em is Ma.

Of course, course one of 'em's Ma. What's the matter with you.

Night, you guys.

Oh look, it's the woman we ordered.

Hey. Can, uh, can we help you?

Oh, no thanks, I'm just waiting for, uh, Joey Tribbiani.

I'm Joey Tribbiani.

Oh no, not you, big Joey. Oh my God, you're so much cuter than your pictures! I-I'm, I'm Ronni....Cheese Nip?

Uh, Joey's having an embolism, but I'd go for a Nip, y'know?

Hey, Kicky. What're you doing?

Just trying to get comfortable. I can't sleep in my underwear.

Well, you're gonna.

I've been thinking. Y'know, about how I'm always seeing girls on top of girls...

Are they end to end, or tall like pancakes?

Y'know what I mean, about how I'm always going out with all these women. And I always figured, when the right one comes along, I'd be able to be a stand-up guy and go the distance, y'know? Now I'm looking at my dad, thinking...

Hey, you're not him. You're you. When they were all over you to go into your father's pipe-fitting business, did you cave?

No.

No. You decided to go into the out-of-work actor business. Now that wasn't easy, but you did it! And I'd like to believe that when the right woman comes along, you will have the courage and the guts to say "No thanks, I'm married."

You really think so?

Yeah. I really do.

Thanks, Chandler.

Get off!

Hi.

Hi...May I help you?

Yeah, uh, Joey said I could use your shower, since, uh, Chandler's in ours?

Okay...who are you?

Oh, I'm Ronni. Ronni Rappelano? The mistress?

Oh, c'mon in.

Thanks.

Hi, I'm Rachel.

Hi.

Bathroom's up there.

Great.

Hey, listen, Ronni, how long would you say Chandler's been in the shower?

Oh, like, uh, five minutes?

Perfect. Fasten your seatbelts, it's peepee time. Hey, Mr. Trib.

Hey. Morning, dear.

Chandler Bing? It's time to see your thing.

What's the matter with you?!

I thought it was Chandler!

What? What?

You were supposed to be in there so I could see your thing!

Sorry, my my thing was in there with me.

Hey, Pheebs.

Hey.

How's it going?

Good. Oh oh! Roger's having a dinner thing and he wanted me to invite you guys.

So what's going on?

Nothing, um, it's just, um... It's Roger.

I dunno, there's just something about...

Basically we just feel that he's...

We hate that guy.

Yeah. Hate him.

We're sorry, Pheebs, we're sorry.

Uh-huh. Okay. Okay, don't you think, maybe, though, it's just that he's so perceptive that it freaks you out?

...No, we hate him.

We're sorry.

Ma! What're you doing here?

I came to give you this and this.

Oww! Big ring!

Why did you have to fill your father's head with all that garbage about making things right? Things were fine the way they were! There's chicken in there, put it away. For God's sake, Joey, really.

Hold on, you-you knew?

Of course I knew! What did you think? Your father is no James Bond. You should've heard some of his cover stories. "I'm sleeping over at my accountant's," I mean, what is that? Please!

So then how could you I mean, how could you?!

Do you remember how your father used to be? Always yelling, always yelling nothing made him happy, nothing made him happy, not that wood shop, not those stupid little ships in the bottle, nothing. Now he's happy! I mean, it's nice, he has a hobby.

Ma, I don't mean to be disrespectful, but... what the hell are you talking about?! I mean, what about you?

Me? I'm fine. Look, honey, in an ideal world, there'd be no her, and your father would look like Sting. And I'll tell you something else. Ever since that poodle-stuffer came along, he's been so ashamed of himself that he's been more attentive, he's been more loving... I mean, it's like every day's our anniversary.

I'm...happy...for you?

Well don't be, because now everything's screwed up. I just want it the way it was.

Ma, I'm sorry. I just did what I thought you'd want.

I know you did, cookie. Oh, I know you did. So tell me. Did you see her?

Yeah. You're ten times prettier than she is.

That's sweet. Could I take her?

With this ring? No contest.

What's wrong, sweetie?

Nothing, nothing.

Aaaah, what's wrong, c'mon.

It's, I mean, it's nothing, I'm fine. It's my friends. They-they have a liking problem with you. In that, um, they don't.

Oh. They don't.

But they don't see all the wonderfulness that I see. They don't see all the good stuff and all the sweet stuff. They just think you're a little...

What?

Intense and creepy.

Oh.

But I don't. Me, Phoebe.

Well, I'm not I'm not at all surprised they feel that way.

You're not? See, that's why you're so great!

Actually it's, it's quite, y'know, typical behaviour when you have this kind of dysfunctional group dynamic. Y'know, this kind of co-dependant, emotionally stunted, sitting in your stupid coffee house with your stupid big cups which, I'm sorry, might as well have nipples on them, and you're like all 'Oh, define me! Define me! Love me, I need love!'.

So you talked to your dad, huh.

Yeah. He's gonna keep cheating on my ma like she wanted, she's gonna keep pretending she doesn't know even though she does, and my little sister Tina can't see her husband any more because he got a restraining order...which has nothing to do with anything except that I found out today.

Wow.

Things sure have changed here on Waltons mountain.

So Joey, you okay?

Yeah, I guess. It's just parents, after a certain point, you gotta let go. Even if you know better, you've gotta let them make their own mistakes.

Just think, in a couple of years we get to turn into them.

If I turn into my parents, I'll either be an alcoholic blond chasing after twenty-year-old boys, or... I'll end up like my mom.

Hey.

Hey, Pheebs.

How's it going?

Oh, okay, except I broke up with Roger.

Awww.

Yeah, right.

Aaawwwwww!!

What happened?

I don't know, I mean, he's a good person, and he can be really sweet, and in some ways I think he is so right for me, it's just... I hate that guy!

Hey, Joey. What's going on?

Clear the tracks for the boobie payback express. Next stop: Rachel Green.

Joey!! What the hell were you doing?!

Sorry. Wrong boobies.

Hello, Joey.

Oh! ...Hello, dear.
