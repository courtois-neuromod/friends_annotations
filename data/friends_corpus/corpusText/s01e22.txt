Tell him.

No.

Tell him, tell him.

Just...please tell him.

Shut up!

Tell me what?

Look at you, you won't even look at him.

Oh, come on tell me. I could use another reason why women won't look at me.

All right, all right, all right. Last night, I had a dream that, uh, you and I, were...

Doing it on this table.

Wow!

Exellent dream score.

Why, why, why would you dream that?

More importantly, was I any good?

Well, you were pretty damn good.

Interesting, cause in my dreams, I'm allways surprisingly inadequate.

Well, last night you seemed to know your way around the table.

I love it, when we share.

You're okay there?

I can't belive you two had sex in her dream.

I'm sorry, it was a one-time-thing. I was very drunk and i was somebody else's subconscious.

Can you hear that?

Yeah?

See that'll stop when you pick up the phone.

Oh. Uh, I'm on.

Mr. Bing's office. No I'm sorry, he's in a meeting right now.

I'm not in a meeting. I'm right... Whoops.

Will he know what this is in reference to? And he has your number? All right, I'll see that he gets the message. Bye bye.

What?

Ross says hi.

Ah!

This is so fun. All right, what do we do now?

Well, now, I actually have to get to work.

Most likely. Okay, I'm gonna be out there.

Okay.

All right. Bye bye.

Bye bye.

Yes?

Whatcha doin'?

Ooh.

Windows are clean, candels are lit. Uh, belt's to tight, gotta change the belt. Did I turn the fish? No, cause I made lasagne. Am I out of control?

Just a touch. Mon, I don't understand. I mean, you've been dating this guy since like, what... his midterms? I mean, why all the sudden are you so... Oh.

What?

Could tonight be the Night?

I don't know. Look he's a great guy and I love being with him but... you know. Things happen, and they happen. You don't plan these things.

So, did you shave your legs?

Yeah.

A-ha!

What we did was wrong. Oh god, I just had sex with somebody that wasn't alive during the Bicentennial.

I just had sex.

Ethan, focus. How could you not tell me?

Well, you never told me how old you were.

Well, that's different. My lie didn't make one of us a felon in 48 states. What were you thinking?

I wasn't thinking. I was too busy fallin'...

Don't say it.

...in love with you.

Really?

Sorry.

Well,fall out of it. You know, you shouldn't even be here, it's a school night. Oh god, oh god. I'm like those women that you see with shiny guys named Chad. I'm Joan Collins.

Who?

I Think last night was great. You know, the Karaoke thing. Tracy and I doing Ebony and Ivory.

You were great. But they still made fun of you.

What?

You know, now you're more like, you know like, "Mr. Caring Boss," "Mr.", you know, "I'm one of you, Boss," "Mr., I wanna be your buddy, Boss Man Bing!"

Then, I don't get it.

Well, you know what Chandler? I think you've gotta face it. You're like, the guy in the big office, you know. You're the one that hires them, that fires them... They still say you're a great boss.

They do?

Uh huh. But they're not your friends anymore.

I just wan't to...

No, but you can't.

But I just wa...

Uh uh.

Aren't you gonna...

Oh, Carol and I have a new system. If she punches in 911, it means she's having a baby, otherwise I just ignore it.

What about Andre?

Oh, well this morning he got a call from who I think was our cousin Nathan, and frankly, it was a little more than I needed to know.

Hey.

That was gonna be my opener.

Hey, did you guys check out those new hand-dryers in the bathroom?

I thought that was just a rumour.

True story.

They're here already?

All right, look. I've gotta tell you something. I'm not 17. I only said so that you'd think I was cute and vunerable. I'm actually 30, I have a wife, I have a job, I'm your Congressman. Monica, this is ridiculous, we're great together. We can talk, we make each other laugh, and the sex. Oh, man, okay i have no frame of graft, but I thought that was great.

It was.

Then, what's the problem?

Ethan, it's um... it's icky.

Icky? You're actually gonna throw this away because it's icky?

This isn't easy for me either. I wish things were different, I... If you were a few years older, or if I was a few years younger, or if we lived in biblical times, I would really...

No, don't say it.

...love you.

Are you're hands still wet?

Uh, moist, yeah.

Let's dry 'em again.

Uh, like, could these margaritas be any stronger? Hey, Chandler.

Hello, Mr. Bing.

Loved your Stevie Wonder last night.

Thanks. Listen, about the weekly numbers, I'm gonna need them on my desk by nine o'clock.

Sure.

No problem.

You have to give 'em something, you know. Okay, now that was Gerston, Santos, and who's the guy with the moustache?
