Dehydrated Japanese noodles under fluorescent lights... does it get better than this?

Question. You're not dating anybody, are you, because I met somebody who would be perfect for you.

Ah, y'see, perfect might be a problem. Had you said 'co-dependent', or 'self-destructive'...

Do you want a date Saturday?

Yes please.

Okay. He's cute, he's funny, he's-

He's a he?

Well yeah! ...Oh God. I- just- I thought- Good, Shelley. I'm just gonna go flush myself down the toilet now... Okay, goodbye...

...Couldn't enjoy a cup of noodles after that. I mean, is that ridiculous? Can you believe she actually thought that?

Um... yeah. Well, I mean, when I first met you, y'know, I thought maybe, possibly, you might be...

You did?

Yeah, but then you spent Phoebe's entire birthday party talking to my breasts, so then I figured maybe not.

Huh. Did, uh... any of the rest of you guys think that when you first met me?

I did.

Yeah, I think so, yeah.

Not me.

Nono, me neither. Although, uh, y'know, back in college, Susan Sallidor did.

You're kidding! Did you tell her I wasn't?

No. No, it's just 'cause, uh, I kinda wanted to go out with her too, so I told her, actually, you were seeing Bernie Spellman... who also liked her, so...

Well, this is fascinating. So, uh, what is it about me?

I dunno, 'cause you're smart, you're funny...

Ross is smart and funny, d'you ever think that about him?

Yeah! Right!

WHAT IS IT?!

Okay, I-I d'know, you-you just- you have a quality.

Yes. Absolutely. A quality.

Oh, oh, a quality, good, because I was worried you guys were gonna be vague about this.

Hello? Hello? Oh! Rachel, it's Paolo calling from Rome.

Oh my God! Calling from Rome! Bon giorno, caro mio.

So he's calling from Rome. I could do that. Just gotta go to Rome.

Monica, your dad just beeped in, but can you make it quick? Talking to Rome. I'm talking to Rome.

Hey dad, what's up? Oh God. Ross, it's Nana.

I just have to know, okay. Is it my hair?

Yes, Chandler, that's exactly what it is. It's your hair.

Yeah, you have homosexual hair.

So, um, did she...

Twice.

Twice?

Oh, that sucks!

You guys okay?

I dunno, it's weird. I mean, I know she's gone, but I just don't feel, uh...

Maybe that's 'cause she's not really gone.

Nono, she's gone.

We checked. A lot.

Hm, I mean maybe no-one ever really goes. Ever since my mom died, every now and then, I get the feeling that she's like right here, y'know? Oh! And Debbie, my best friend from junior high- got struck by lightning on a miniature golf course- I always get this really strong Debbie vibe whenever I use one of those little yellow pencils, y'know? ...I miss her.

Aw. Hey, Pheebs, want this?

Thanks!

Sure. I just sharpened her this morning.

Now, see, I don't believe any of that. I think once you're dead, you're dead! You're gone! You're worm food! ...So Chandler looks gay, huh?

Y'know, I dunno who this is, but it's not Debbie.

I thought it was gonna be a closed casket.

Well, that doesn't mean she can't look nice!

Sweetie, you think you can get in there?

I don't see why not.

Here's my retainer!

I was just thinking. When my time comes-

Dad!

Listen to me! When my time comes, I wanna be buried at sea.

You what?

I wanna be buried at sea, it looks like fun.

Define fun.

C'mon, you'll make a day of it! You'll rent a boat, pack a lunch...

...And then we throw your body in the water... Gee, that does sound fun.

Everyone thinks they know me. Everyone says 'Jack Geller, so predictable'. Maybe after I'm gone, they'll say 'Buried at sea! Huh!'.

That's probably what they'll say.

I'd like that.

Hey, gorgeous.

Hey. Look, I'm sorry about yesterday, I, um-

No, nono, don't- don't worry about it. Believe me, apparently other people have made the same mistake.

Oh! Okay! Phew!

So, uh... what do you think it is about me?

I dunno, uh... you just have a-a...

...Quality, right, great.

Y'know, it's a shame, because you and Lowell would've made a great couple.

Lowell? Financial Services' Lowell, that's who you saw me with?

What? He's cute!

Well, yeah... 's'no Brian in Payroll.

Is Brian...?

No! Uh, I d'know! The point is, if you were gonna set me up with someone, I'd like to think you'd set me up with someone like him.

Well, I think Brian's a little out of your league.

Excuse me? You don't think I could get a Brian? Because I could get a Brian. Believe you me. ...I'm really not.

This one?

No.

I have shown you everything we have. Unless you want your mother to spend eternity in a lemon yellow pant-suit, go with the burgundy.

You know, whatever we pick, she would've told us it's the wrong one.

You're right. We'll go with the burgundy.

Oh! A fine choice. I'm coming out.

Wait! We need shoes!

Okay. Um, how about these?

That's really a day shoe.

And where she's going everyone else'll be dressier?

Could we see something in a slimmer heel?

Okay, I have nothing in an evening shoe in the burgundy. I can show you something in a silver that may work.

No, it really should be burgundy.

Mm. Unless we go with a different dress?

No! Nonono, wait a sec. I may have something in the back.

Oh my God..

Is everything all right, dear?

Yeah, just... just Nana stuff.

How we doing, you guys ready?

Mom already called this morning to remind me not to wear my hair up. Did you know my ears are not my best feature?

Some days it's all I can think about.

Hi, sorry I'm late, I couldn't find my bearings.

Oh, you-you mean your earrings?

What'd I say?

Hm-m.

Are these the shoes?

Yes. Paolo sent them from Italy.

What, we-uh- we don't have shoes here, or...?

Morning. We ready to go?

Well, don't we look nice all dressed up?...It's stuff like that, isn't it?

It was a really beautiful service.

It really was. Oh, c'mere, sweetheart. Y'know, I think it might be time for you to start using night cream.

What?

Nothing, just your overcoat sounds remarkably like Brent Mussberger.

Check it out, Giants-Cowboys.

You're watching a football game at a funeral?

No, it's the pre-game. I'm gonna watch it at the reception.

You are a frightening, frightening man.

Oh no! My new Paolo shoes!

Oh, I hope they're not ruined.

God, what a great day. ...What? Weather-wise!

I know, uh, the air, the-the trees... even though Nana's gone there's, there's something almost, uh- I dunno, almost life-aff-

God! Ross!

I'm fine. Just-just... having my worst fear realised...

Hey, who's this little naked guy?

That little naked guy would be me.

Aww, look at the little thing.

Yes, yes, fine, that is my penis. Can we be grown-ups now?

Who are those people?

Got me.

Oh, that's Nana, right there in the middle. 'Me and the gang at Java Joe's'.

Wow, Monica, you look just like your grandmother. How old was she there?

Let's see, 1939... yeah, 24, 25?

Looks like a fun gang.

Ooh, look-look-look-look-look! I got Monica naked!

Nono, that would be me again. I'm, uh, just trying something.

Hey, Lowell.

Hey, Chandler.

So how's it going there in Financial Services?

It's like Mardi Gras without the paper mache heads. How 'bout you?

Good, good. Listen, heh, I dunno what Shelley told you about me, but, uh... I'm not.

I know. That's what I told her.

Really.

Yeah.

So- you can tell?

Pretty much, most of the time. We have a kind of... radar.

So you don't think I have a, a quality?

Speaking for my people, I'd have to say no. By the way, your friend Brian from Payroll, he is.

He is?

Yup, and waaay out of your league.

Out of my league. I could get a Brian. If I wanted to get a Brian, I could get a Brian. Hey, Brian.
