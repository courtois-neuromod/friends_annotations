So what did he decide? Does your Uncle Nathan get an invite or not?

Ohh, God, nobody likes him, and he's so cheap, he'd never fly to London in a million years. Yeah, invite him? Hey, did I do these neat enough?

Yeah, they're fine.

Yeah?

If anyone asks, we'll just say Ben addressed them. Oh! So you invited Rachel then?

Sure. Why not?

Really?

Yeah?

I don't think I'd be comfortable with any of my old lovers there.

Wait-wait-wait, do you, do you think, maybe we shouldn't invite her?

Oh, no-no, y'know I absolutely adore Rachel it's just that, well it might be a awkward for you. But it's absolutely your decision. More tea?

Yeah sure.

Earl Grey?

Huh? Yeah, fine, invite whoever you want.

I don't want to be single, okay? I just... I just- I just wanna be married again!

And I just want a million dollars!

Rachel?!

Oh God Monica hi! I just went to your building and you weren't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are, you are!

Okay, everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor. This is everybody, this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my brother Ross?

Hi, sure!

Hi.

You know you probably didn't know this, but back in high school, I had a, um, major crush on you.

I knew.

You did! Oh.... I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geeky older brother.

I did.

Oh. Listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor here-but do you think it would be okay if I asked you out? Sometime? Maybe?

Yeah, maybe...

Okay... okay, maybe I will...

See, I see.... big passion in your future.

Really?

I do.

Oh Ross, you're so great.

It's never gonna happen.

Hey, I have a question. Well, actually, it's not so much a question as.. more of a general wondering... ment.

Okay.

Okay. Umm, for a while now, I've been wanting to, um....

Ohhh!!!!

Yes, yes, that's right...

Oh, look at the little cat! Look at it!

What? Ow!

I'm on top of the world, looking down on creation and the only explanation I can find...

All right, listen, missy. If you want this cart, you're gonna have to take me with it!

Yes! Did you see that?

You were incredible! Brand new woman, ladies and gentlemen.

I could not have done this without you.

Ok, um, uh, more clothes in the dryer? I'm fine, I'm fine.

You had no right to tell me you ever had feelings for me.

What?

I was doing great with Julie before I found out about you.

Hey, I was doin' great before I found out about you. You think it's easy for me to see you with Julie?

The point is I... I don't need this right now, OK. It, it's too late, I'm with somebody else, I'm happy. This ship has sailed.

Alright, fine, you go ahead and you do that, alright Ross.

Fine.

'Cause I don't need your stupid ship.

Good.

Good.

Ross do you realise this is the first time in my life I'm doing something I actually care about. This is the first time in my life I'm doing something that I'm actually good at. I mean. if you don't get that...

No, hey, I get that, okay, I get that big time. And I'm happy for ya, but I'm tired of having a relationship with your answering machine! Okay, I don't know what to do anymore.

Well neither do I!

Is this about Mark?

Oh my God.

Okay, it's not, it's not.

Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight over and over again, Ross, no, you're, you're, you're making this too hard.

Oh I'm, I'm making this too hard. Okay, what do you want me to do.

I don't know, I don't know. Urrrgh! Look, maybe we should take a break.

Okay, okay, fine, you're right. Let's ah, let's take a break, let's cool off, okay, let's get some frozen yogart, or something..

No. A break from us.

Do I know why we're rushing?

Yeah, y'know the ah, the girlfriend I told you about last night? Well it turns out she ah, she wants to get back together with me. Oh, I found it!!

That's so great for you guys!

Yeah!

Good luck, with your girlfriend.

Oh, thank you. Hey, hey. Rachel!!!!

Hi. Ohhh, you got my message.

Yeah, oh hey, you are right on time.

So what do you say? Can I be your girlfriend again?

Yes, you can, very much.

Ahhhh!!

Y'know what, I want you to leave! Get outta here!

No!!

Just get out! Now!!

No!! No!! I wanna stay. I wanna talk about this.

Okay! All right! How was she?

Uh-oh.

What?

Was she good?

Don't answer that.

Come on Ross! You said you wanted to talk about it, let's talk about it!! How was she?

She was...

Awful! Horrible!

She was not good. Not good.

She was nothing compared to you.

She, she was different.

Ewwwww!

Uh-oh.

Good different?

Nobody likes change.

What? Okay, okay, okay, okay.

You seem to really like her.

Yeah, I really do. Yeah, but what am I gonna do, I mean we-we both agreed that it was gonna be a two-week thing, y'know no commitment.

Ross, that girl just spent the entire evening talking to your friends, asking to hear stories about you, looking through Monica's photo albums, I mean you don't do that if you're just in it for two weeks.

You think?

Yeah, you got like 14 hours until she has to be at the airport, and you're sitting here in the hallway with a 28-year-old cheerleader with a fat lip.

Hey, you're right.

Yeah.

Who's this from?

Oh, that's Ross's.

Oh... Oh my God. He remembered.

Remembered what?

It was like months ago. We were walking by this antique store, and I saw this pin in the window, and I told him that it was just like one my grandmother had when I was a little girl. Oh! I can't believe he remembered!

Oh, it's so pretty. This must have cost him a fortune.

I can't believe he did this.

Come on, Ross? Remember back in college, when he fell in love with Carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?

What did you just say?

F-hah.... flennin....

Oh.... my God.

Rach, I got a message from you.

Oh my God. Oh my God Ross, no, hang up the phone, give me the phone Ross, give me the phone, give me the phone, give me the. . .

You're over me?

Ohhhhhhhh God.

Wha... you're uh, you're, you're over me?

Ohh, ohh.

When, when were you... under me?

Well, basically, lately, I've uh, I've uh, sort of had feelings for you.

OK, I need to lie down.

He broke up with Julie. Well, go hug her, for god's sakes.

Really?

Really. It's always been you, Rach.

Oh, god.

Ohhh.

Y'know, hey! You're the one who ended it, remember?

Yeah, because I was mad at you, not because I stopped loving you!

You still love me?

Noo.

What does this mean? What do you, I mean do you wanna, get back together?

Noo! Maybe! I, I don't know.

What?!

I just, I feel, I-I just...

All right, check it out. Check this out. It says here that there's a place you can go to rent videos of all the museums! "It's almost as good as being there."

It's better! You can't go to a museum in your underwear!

Well, You could, but... probably just the one time.

I bet we could get videos of all the sites, get a VCR in our hotel room... we'd never even have to go outside!

If we do that, we gotta get Die Hard.

Oh-ho! I bet the British version is gooooood!
