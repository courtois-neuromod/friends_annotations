And here's little Ben nodding off...

Awww, look at Aunt Monica's little boy!

Oh, look, he's got Ross's haircut!

Oh, let me see! Oh, God, is he just the sweetest thing? You must just want to kiss him all over!

That would be nice.

Pardon?

Nothing, just a little extra air in my mouth. Pffft. Pffffffft.

Hey, Chan, can you help me out here? I promise I'll pay you back.

Oh, yeah, right, OK... inlcuding the waffles last week, you now owe me... 17 jillion dollars.

I will, really. I'll pay you back this time.

... And where's this money coming from?

Well... I'm helping out down at the N.Y.U. Med School with some... research.

What kind of research?

Oh, just, y'know.... science.

Science. Yeah, I think I've heard of that.

... It's a fertility study.

Oh, Joey, please tell me you're only donating your time.

Alright, come on you guys, it's not that big a deal. Really... I mean, I just go down there every other day and... make my contribution to the project. Hey, hey, but at the end of two weeks, I get seven hundred dollars.

Hey.

Wow, ooh, you're gonna be making money hand over fist!

I mean, this is unbelievable.

I know. This is really, really huge.

No it's not. It's small. It's tiny. It's petite. It's wee.

Nuh-uh. I don't think any of our lives are ever gonna be the same ever again.

OK, is there a mute button on this woman?

I think this is so great! I mean, you and Ross! D-did you have any idea?

No! None! I mean, my first night in the city, he mentioned something about asking me out, but nothing ever happened, so I just... : W-well, what else did he say? I mean, does he, like, want to go out with me?

Well, given that he's desperately in love with you, he probably wouldn't mind getting a cup of coffee or something.

Ross? All this time? Well, I've got to talk to him.

H-He's in China!

The country.

No, no, wait. His flight doesn't leave for another forty-five more minutes.

What about the time difference?

From here to the airport?

Yes! You're never gonna make it!

Rachel, what're you gonna say to him?

I-I-I don't know.

Well then maybe you shouldn't go.

He's right, cause if you're just gonna, like, break his heart, that's the kind of thing that can wait.

Yeah, but if it's good news, you should tell him now.

I don't know. Maybe I'll know when I see him.

Here, look, alright, does this help?

Noooo... look, all I know is that I cannot wait a week until I see him. I mean, this is just too big. Y'know, I just, I've just gotta talk to him. I... I gotta... OK, I'll see you later.

Rachel, I love you! Deal with me first!

Alright!

Ni-chou chi-ma!

Ross! Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me....

Hi!

Hi.

May I see your boarding pass?

Oh, no, no, I don't have one. I just need to talk to my friend.

Oh, oooh. I'm sorry. You are not allowed on the jetway unless you have a boarding pass.

No, I know, but Ihe just went on. He's right there, he's got the blue jacket on, I... can I j-just...

No no no! Federal regulations!

OK, alright, OK, um... then could you please, uh... just give him a message for me? Please? This is very important.

Alright. What's the message?

Uh... I don't know.

Sir? Sir? Excuse me, sir? Uh... I have a message for you.

What?

It's from Rachel. She said that she loved the present, and she will see you when you get back.

: Toby... Oh, for God's sake, I don't know what she's talking about! There's no Rachel! Don't give me that deep freeze.

Mmmmmm... Oh, Joey, Joey, Joey... I think I blacked out there for a minute!

Heh, heh. It was nothin'.

Well, now we've gotta find something fun for you!

Uhhh.. y'know what? Forget about me. Let's, uh... let's give you another turn.

M-Me again?

Sure! Why not?

Boy, somebody's gonna get a big fruit basket tomorrow.

Oooh, I gotta tell you... you are nothing like I thought you would be.

How do you mean?

I don't know, I-I guess I just had you pegged as one of those guys who're always 'me, me, me.' But you... you're a giver. You're like the most generous man I ever met. I mean... you're practically a woman.

Uh, so, uh, Rach, uh... do you wanna save this wrapping paper, I mean, it's only a little bit torn... so are you gonna go for it with Ross or should I just throw it out?

I don't know. I don't know... I thought about it all the way there, and I thought about it all the way back... and, uh, oh, you guys, y'know, it's Ross. Y'know what I mean? I mean, it's Ross.

Sure.

I don't know, I mean, this is just my initial gut feeling... but I'm thinking... oh, I'm thinking it'd be really great.

Oh my God, me too! Oh! Oh, we'd be like friends-in-law! Y'know what the best part is? The best part is that you already know everything about him! I mean, it's like starting on the fifteenth date!

Yeah, but, y'know, it's... it would be like starting on the fifteenth date.

Another good point.

No, I mean, I mean, when you're at the fifteenth date, y'know, you're already in a very relationshippy place. Y'know, it's... you're committed.

Huh?

Well, I mean, then what happens if it doesn't work out?

Why isn't it working out?

I don't know... sometimes it doesn't.

Is he not cute enough for you?

No!

Does he not make enough money?

No, I'm just....

Maybe there's someone else.

Wha...

Is there? Is there someone else?

No! There is.. there is noone else!

Then why the hell are you dumping my brother?!?

Hey, big...

Shhhh!

...spender.

She's still asleep.

So how'd it go?

Oh, it was amazing. You know how you always think you're great in bed?

The fact that you'd even ask that question shows how little you know me.

Well, it's like, last night, I couldn't do the thing that usually makes me great. So I had to do all this other stuff. And the response I got... man, oh man, it was like a ticker tape parade!

Yes, I know, as it happens my room is very very close to the parade route.

It was amazing! And not just for her... uh-uh. For me, too. It's like, all of a sudden, I'm blind. But all my other senses are heightened, y'know? It's like... I was able to appreciate it on another level.

I didn't know you had another level.

I know! Neither did I!

Hey, great skirt! Birthday present?

Yeah.

Oh, from who?

From you. I exchanged the blouse you got me.

Well, it's the thought. Hey, doesn't Ross's flight get in in a couple hours? At gate 27-B?

Uh, yeah. Uh, Monica, y'know, honey, I've been thinking about it and I've decided thisthis whole Ross thing, it's just not a good idea.

Oh, why?

Because, I feel like I wouldn't just be going out with him. I would be going out with all of you. Oh, and there would just be all this pressure, and I don't wanna...

No, no, no, no, no, no pressure, no pressure!

Monica, nothing has even happened yet, and you're already so...

I am not 'so'! OK, I was a teensy bit weird at first, but... I'll be good. I promise.

Who is it?

It's me, Carl.

C'mon up.

Behind my brother's back? ... is exactly the kind of crazy thing you won't be hearing from me.

Seven hundred bucks!

Alright, you did it! Do we have any fruit?

Man, hell of a two weeks, huh? Y'know what, though? I really feel like I learned something.

Really? So, you're gonna stick with this 'it's all for her' thing?

What, are you crazy? When a blind man gets his sight back, does he walk around like this?

Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me, excuse me, sorry. Hi.

For God's sake, will you let it go? There's no Rachel!

Oh, hey, hey, I got that.

Oh, thanks, sweetie.

No problem. I cannot wait for you to meet my friends.

Really?

Yeah.

You don't think they'll judge and ridicule me?

No, no, they will. I just... uh...

Can't wait.

Come on, they're gonna love you.
