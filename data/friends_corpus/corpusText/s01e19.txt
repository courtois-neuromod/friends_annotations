Mail call, Rachel Green, bunk seven.

Thank you. Oh, cool! Free sample of coffee!

Oh good! 'Cause where else would we get any?

Oh. Right. ...Oh great.

What is it?

Country club newsletter. My mother sends me the engagement notices for 'inspiration.' Oh my God! Oh my God, it's Barry and Mindy!

Barry who you almost...?

Barry who I almost.

And Mindy, your maid of...?

Mindy, my maid of. Oh!

That's Mindy? Wow, she is pretty. Lucky. To have had a friend like you.

I can't believe we are even having this discussion.

I agree. I'm, like, in disbelief.

I mean, don't you think if things were gonna happen with Rachel, they would've happened already?

I'm telling you, she said she's looking for a relationship with someone exactly like me.

She really said that?

Well, I added the 'exactly like me' part... But she said she's looking for someone, and someone is gonna be there tonight.

'Tonight' tonight?

Well, I think it's perfect. Y'know, it's just gonna be the two of us, she spent all day taking care of my monkey...

I can't remember the last time I got a girl to take care of my monkey.

Anyway, I figured after work I'd go pick up a bottle of wine, go over there and, uh, try to woo her.

Hey, y'know what you should do? You should take her back to the 1890's, when that phrase was last used.

It'll be nice to get this off finally, won't it? Yes it will. Or we can leave it on for now, that's fine.

Y'know, with the right pair of pumps, that would be a great little outfit.

Listen, I'm- I'm sorry I was so hard on you before, it's just I...

Oh, Ross, c'mon. It's my fault, I almost lost your...

Yeah, but you were the one who got him back, y'know? You, you were great. ...Hey, we uh, we still have that, uh, that bottle of wine. You in the mood for, uh, something grape?

That'd be good.

Alright. The, uh, the neighbours must be vacuuming. Well, so long as we're here and, uh, not on the subject, I was thinking about, uh, how mad we got at each other before, and, um, I was thinking maybe it was partially because of how we, um...

Rachel.

Barry?!

I can't. I can't do it, I can't marry Mindy. I think I'm still in love with you.

Oh!

We have got to start locking that door!

This is me in The Sound of Music. See the von Trapp kids?

Nope.

That's because I'm in front of them.

Eh. I thought that was an alp.

Well, high school was not my favourite time.

I dunno, I loved high school. Y'know? It was just four years of parties and dating and sex.

Yeah, well I went to boarding school with four hundred boys. Any sex I had would've involved a major lifestyle choice.

Gosh, doesn't it seem like a million years ago?

Oh. Oooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! My butt cheek is waking up! Oooh! Ooh!
