Hi guys!

Hey, Pheebs! Hi!

Hey. Oh, oh, how'd it go?

Um, not so good. He walked me to the subway and said 'We should do this again!'

Ohh. Ouch.

What? He said 'we should do it again', that's good, right?

Uh, no. Loosely translated 'We should do this again' means 'You will never see me naked'.

Since when?

Since always. It's like dating language. Y'know, like 'It's not you' means 'It is you'.

Or 'You're such a nice guy' means 'I'm gonna be dating leather-wearing alcoholics and complaining about them to you'.

Or, or, y'know, um, 'I think we should see other people' means 'Ha, ha, I already am'.

And everybody knows this?

Yeah. Cushions the blow.

Yeah, it's like when you're a kid, and your parents put your dog to sleep, and they tell you it went off to live on some farm.

That's funny, that, no, because, uh, our parents actually did, uh, send our dog off to live on a farm.

Uh, Ross.

What? Wh- hello? The Millners' farm in Connecticut? The Millners, they had this unbelievable farm, they had horses, and, and rabbits that he could chase and it was- it w- .....Oh my God, Chi Chi!

"So how does it feel knowing you're about to die?"

"Warden, in five minutes my pain will be over. But you'll have to live with the knowledge that you sent an honest man to die."

Hey, that was really good!

Thanks! Let's keep going.

Okay. "So. Whaddya want from me, Damone, huh?"

"I just wanna go back to my cell. 'Cause in my cell, I can smoke."

"Smoke away."

I think this is probably why Damone smokes in his cell alone.

What?

Relax your hand!

Not so much!

Whoah!

Hey!

Hey!

Alright, now try taking a puff.

Alright.. okay. No. Give it to me.

No no no, I am not giving you a cigarette.

It's fine, it's fine. Look, do you wanna get this part, or not? Here.

Don't think of it as a cigarette. Think of it as the thing that's been missing from your hand. When you're holding it, you feel right. You feel complete.

Y'miss it?

Nah, not so much. Alright, now we smoke. Oh.. my.. God.

Hi.. how was the game?

Well..

WE WON!! Thank you! Yes!

Fantastic! I have one question: How is that possible?

Alan.

He was unbelievable. He was like that-that-that Bugs Bunny cartoon where Bugs is playing all the positions, right, but instead of Bugs it was first base-Alan, second base-Alan, third base-...

I mean, it-it was like, it was like he made us into a team.

Yep, we sure showed those Hassidic jewellers a thing or two about softball..

Can I ask you guys a question? D'you ever think that Alan is maybe.. sometimes..

What?

..I dunno, a little too Alan?

Well, no. That's impossible. You can never be too Alan.

Yeah, it's his, uh, innate Alan-ness that-that-that we adore.

I personally could have a gallon of Alan.

Hey, Lizzie.

Hey, Weird Girl.

I brought you alphabet soup.

Did you pick out the vowels?

Yes. But I left in the Ys. 'Cause, y'know, "sometimes y". Uh, I also have something else for you.

Saltines?

No, but would you like a thousand dollars and a football phone?

What? Oh my God, there's really money in here.

I know.

Weird Girl, what are you doing?

No, I want you to have it. I don't want it.

No, no, I ha-I have to give you something.

Oh, that's fine, no.

Would you like my tin-foil hat?

No. 'Cause you need that. No, it's okay, thanks.

Please, let me do something.

Okay, alright, you buy me a soda, and then we're even. Okay?

Okay.

Okay.

A thumb?!

Eww!

I know! I know, I opened it up and there it was, just floating in there, like this tiny little hitch-hiker!

Well, maybe it's a contest, y'know? Like, collect all five?

Does, um, anyone wanna see?

Nooo!

Oh, hey, don't do that! Cut it out!

It's worse than the thumb!

Hey, this is so unfair!

Oh, why is it unfair?

So I have a flaw! Big deal! Like Joey's constant knuckle-cracking isn't annoying? And Ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word? And Monica, with that snort when she laughs? I mean, what the hell is that thing? ...I accept all those flaws, why can't you accept me for this?

...Does the knuckle-cracking bother everybody?

Well, I-I could live without it.

Well, is it, like, a little annoying, or is it like when Phoebe chews her hair?

Oh, now, don't listen to him, Pheebs, I think it's endearing.

Oh, "you do, do you"?

You know, there's nothing wrong with speaking correctly.

"Indeed there isn't"... I should really get back to work.

Yeah, 'cause otherwise someone might get what they actually ordered.

Ohh-ho-hooohhh. The hair comes out, and the gloves come on.

Did you ever go out with a guy your friends all really like?

No.

Okay.. Well, I'm going out with a guy my friends all really like.

Waitwait.. we talking about the coyotes here? All right, a cow got through!

Can you believe it? ...Y'know what? I just don't feel the thing. I mean, they feel the thing, I don't feel the thing.

Honey.. you should always feel the thing. Listen, if that's how you feel about the guy, Monica, dump him!

I know.. it's gonna be really hard.

Well, he's a big boy, he'll get over it.

No, he'll be fine. It's the other five I'm worried about.

Do you have any respect for your body?

Don't you realise what you're-you're doing to yourself?

Hey, y'know, I have had it with you guys and your cancer and your emphysema and your heart disease. The bottom line is, smoking is cool, and you know it.

Chandler? It's Alan, he wants to speak to you.

Really? He does? Hey, buddy, what's up! Oh, she told you about that, huh. Well, yeah, I have one now and then. Well, yeah, now. Well, it's not that big- ..well, that's true,.. Gee, y'know, no-one- no-one's ever put it like that before. Well, okay, thanks!

God, he's good.

If only he were a woman.

Yeah.

Wow.

I'm, I'm really sorry.

Yeah, I'm sorry too. But, I gotta tell you, I am a little relieved.

Relieved?

Yeah, well, I had a great time with you.. I just can't stand your friends.

Remember when we went to Central Park and rented boats?.. That was fun.

Yeah. He could row like a viking.

Hi.

Mmm.

So how'd it go?

Oh, y'know..

Did he mention us?

He said he's really gonna miss you guys.

You had a rough day, huh.. c'mere.

...That's it. I'm getting cigarettes.

No no no!

I don't care, I don't care! Game's over! I'm weak! I've gotta smoke! I've gotta have the smoke!

If you never smoke again I'll give you seven thousand dollars!

Yeah, alright.
