Stop saying you're not talented, you're very talented. It's just with the bird dead and all, there's very little act left. Oh, honey, give me a break, will ya? Oooh, ooh, I'll talk to you later.

Well, there's my favorite client. So tell me darling, how was the audition?

Well, I think it went pretty well. I.. I got a callback for Thursday.

Joey, have you ever seen me ecstatic?

No.

Well, here it is.

OK, uh.... listen, there's something I want to talk to you about. The network casting lady...

Oh, isn't Lori a doll?

Oh yeah, yeah, she's great, but... I kinda got the feeling that she was sort of... coming on to me. And I definitely would get the part if I would've... you know... if I would have sent the Little General in.

Oh, I see. Well, I'm just gonna put in a call here and we'll find out what's goin' on and straighten it out. Yeah, hi, Lori please. Hi darling. So how 'bout Joey Tribbiani for the part of the cab driver, isn't he terrific? Uh-huuuuh. Uh-huuuuh. OK, doll. Talk to you later. Yeah, you're gonna have to sleep with her.

Hey.

Hey.

Whoa, whoa, so I'm guessing you didn't get the part, or... uh, Italy called and said it was hungry.

Well, the part's mine if I want it.

Oh my God!

Yeah, if I'm willing to sleep with the casting lady.

Oh my... God?

Ten years I've been waiting for a break like this Chandler, ten years! I mean, Days of Our Lives. That's actually on television.

So, what're you gonna do?

Well, I guess I could sleep with her... I mean, how could I do that?

Well, I... I've got a pop-up book that told me everything I need to know.

I've never slept with someone for a part.

Well is she...

Sorry.

It's alright. Is she good-looking?

Yeah, she's totally good looking. I mean, if I met her in a bar, or something, I'd be buying her breakfast. You know, after having slept with her.

Y'know, maybe this isn't such a big deal. Y'know, I mean, the way that I see it is you get a great job and you get to have sex. Y'know, I mean, throw in a tree and a fat guy and you've got Christmas.

I just... I just don't think that I want it that way though, y'know? I mean, let's say I do make it, alright? I'm always gonna look back and wonder if it was because of my talent or because of.. y'know, the Little General.

Didn't you used to call it the Little Major?

Yeah, but after Denise DeMarco, I had to promote it.

Can I get you something from the bar?

Yes, I would like something. No, no thank you.

If... if you want to drink, it's OK with me, I've got to get used to it.

No, no really. I.. I wouldn't feel right about it. Just some water.

So the light went out in my refrigerator...

I'd like a scotch on the rocks with a twist.

Hi.

Oh, hey.

Hi.

I guess you guys heard, Rachel dumped me.

Yeah, I'm sorry man.

Oh, all she said was that I remind her too much of somebody. You have any idea who she's talking about?

Oh I do, it's.... it's Bob Saget. She hates him.

Oh.

Hey.

Hey!

Hey, Julie! Hey, how are you doing?

Um, oh, I don't know. I mean, it's definitely weird not being with Ross, but I guess I'm doing OK. Actually I've got some of his stuff that he, um....
