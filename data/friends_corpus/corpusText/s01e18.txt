Alright boys, let's eat.

Oh, did you get that from the 'I Love Rachel' pizzeria?

You still on that?

Oh, come on. What was with that whole Black Bart speech? : "When I play poker, I'm not a nice guy!"

You are way off, pal.

No, I don't think so, see Ross, because I think you love her.

Um.... no. See, I might've had feelings for her at one timenot any more. I justI...

Marcel! Where are you going with that disc?

You are not putting that on again! Marcel, OKif you press that button, you are in very, very big trouble.

Ross, could we please, please, please listen to anything else?

Alright.

I'm gonna pay for that tonight.

Hi!

Hey.

Guys! Guess what, guess what, guess what, guess what!

Um, ok... the... the fifth dentist caved and now they're all recommending Trident?

Noooo... the interview! She loved me! She absolutely loved me. We talked for like two and a half hours, we have the same taste in clothes, andoh, I went to camp with her cousin... And, oh, the job is perfect. I can do this. I can do this well!

That's great! That's wonderful!

Oh God, oh, and then she told the funniest story...

OK, great. You'll tell us and we'll laugh. Let's play poker.

Alright now listen, you guys, we talked about it, and if you don't want to play, we completely understand.

Oh yes, yes, we could play some other game... like, uh, I don't know... Pictionary?

Ha, ha, very funny, very funny. But I think we'd like to give poker another try. Shall we, ladies?

Yes, we should. I think we should.

Uh, Rach, do you want me to shuffle those?

No, no, thats OK. Y'know, I think I'm gonna give it a go.

Alright.

Alright...

So, Phoebs owes $7.50, Monica, you owe $10, and Rachel, you owe fifteen big ones.

But hey, thanks for teachin' us Cross-Eyed Mary. You guys, we gotta play that at our regular game.

Alright, here's my $7.50. But I think you should know that this money is cursed.

What?

Oh, I cursed it. So now bad things will happen to he who spends it.

That's alright, I'll take it. Bad things happen to me anyway. This way I can break 'em up with a movie.

Well, that just leaves the big Green poker machine, who owes fifteen...

Mmm-hmmm. Oh, so typical. Ooo, I'm a man. Ooo, I have a penis. Ooo, I have to win money to exert my power over women.

You know what? This is not over. We will play you again, and we will win, and you will lose, and you will beg, and we will laugh, and we will take every last dime you have, and you will hate yourselves forever.

Hmm. Kinda stepped on my point there, Mon.

Airplane! Airport! Airport '75! Airport '77! Airport '79!

Oh, time's up.

Bye... bye... BIRDIE.

Oh!

That's a bird?

That's a bird!

OK, OK, it's my turn.

Go.

Uh.... bean! Bean!

The Unbearable Likeness of Being!

Yes!

That, you get? That, you get?
