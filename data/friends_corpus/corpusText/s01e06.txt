Ooh! Look! Look! Look! Look, there's Joey's picture! This is so exciting!

You can always spot someone who's never seen one of his plays before. Notice, no fear, no sense of impending doom...

The exclamation point in the title scares me. Y'know, it's not just Freud, it's Freud!

Oh, shhh, shh. Magic is about to happen.

Vell, Eva, ve've done some excellent vork here, and I vould have to say, your pwoblem is qviiite clear.

All you want is a dingle, What you envy's a schwang, A thing through which you can tinkle, Or play with, or simply let hang...

Alright, alright, alright...

Here. I need to borrow some moisturizer.

For what?

Whaddya think? Today's the big day!

Oh my God. Okay, go into the bathroom, use whatever you want, just don't ever tell me what you did in there.

Thank you!

Where's Joey? His mom's on the phone.

He's in the bathroom. I don't think you wanna go in there!

C'mon, we're roommates! My eyes!! My eyes!!

I warned you...

Who is being loud?

Oh, that would be Monica. Hey, listen, I wanna borrow a coupla things, Aurora spent the night, I really wanna make her breakfast.

Oh, you got the whole night, huh?

Yeah, well, I only have twenty minutes until Ethan, so, y'know..

Ooh, do I sense a little bit of resentment?

No, no resentment, believe me, it's worth it. 'Kay? Y'know in a relationship you have these key moments that you know you'll remember for the rest of your life? Well, every- single- second is like that with Aurora.. and I've just wasted about thirty-five of them talking to you people, so, uh.. Monica, can you help me with the door?

Sure. Oh, um, Chandler? Y'know, the-the old Monica would-would remind you to scrub that Teflon pan with a plastic brush...But I'm not gonna do that.

...Dammit, hire the girl! Okay, everybody ready?

Uh, listen, I just wanna thank you for this great opportunity.

Lose the robe.

Me?

That would work.

Right. Okay. Losing the robe. And the robe is lost.

Okay, everybody, we'd like to get this in one take, please. Let's roll it.. water's working .. and... action.

And cut. Hey, Butt Guy, what the hell are you doing?

Well, I'm- I'm showering.

No, that was clenching.

Oh. Well, the way I see it, the guy's upset here, y'know? I mean, his wife's dead, his brother's missing... I think his butt would be angry here.

I think his butt would like to get this shot before lunch. Once again, rolling... water working... and action....and cut. What was that?

I was going for quiet desperation. But if you have to ask...
