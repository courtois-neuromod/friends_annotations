I just walked in the bathroom and saw Kathy naked! It was like torture!

Y'know if we ever go to war and you're captured, you're in for a big surprise.

It just keeps getting worse and worse! Y'know? I mean it's bad enough that I'm in love with my roommates girlfriend-which by the way, I think she knows. Because every time we're in the room together there's this weird like energy between us. And call me crazy, but I think she likes me too. And now I have seen her naked. I mean at least when I've seen her with clothes on, I could imagine her body was like covered in boles or something. But there are no boles, she's smooth! Smooth!

Wow! Could everyone totally see up his robe?

Yeah! Oh my God!

Here you go.

Great! All right, so I'll call you later.

Great!

Hey-Hey-Hey! Who was that?

That would be Casey. We're going out tonight.

Goin' out, huh? Wow! Wow! So things didn't work out with Kathy, huh? Bummer.

No, things are fine with Kathy. I'm having a late dinner with her tonight, right after my early dinner with Casey.

What?

Yeah-yeah. And the craziest thing is that I just ate a whole pizza by myself!

Wait! You're going out with Kathy!

Yeah. Why are you getting so upset?

Well, I'm upset-for you. I mean, having sex with an endless line of beautiful women must be very unfulfilling for you.

What is the big deal? It's not like we're exclusive.

Look, Joey, Kathy is clearly not fulfilling your emotional needs. But Casey, I mean granted I only saw the back of her head, but I got this sense that she's-she's smart, and funny, and gets you.

You got all that from the back of her head?

All right look, I think it's time for you to settle down. Y'know? Make a choice, pick a lane.

Who's Elaine?

No-no-no-no, this is bad! It's bad! This is bad!

Horrible!

Wait the uh, the kiss or the situation?

No-no-no, the kiss was good.

Okay!

No, but that's bad!

Ooh! Yes! Okay! Here's what we do, we-we forget it happened.

What?!

Okay, we-we swallow our feelings. Even if it means we're unhappy forever. Sound good?

Can you really do that?

I have to; he's my best friend, and you're seeing him.

Chandler, I like Joey a lot, but with you...

Oh-no-no-no! Don't! Don't! See-see, you're getting me confused, I'm starting to urn.

I'm sorry. If you wanna pretend that nothing happened, I can try.

I-I think we have too.

Okay. Bye.

Bye. Are you still out there?

No.

Electrifying. Emphatic time-time-time...

Y'know, there's a Starbucks about three blocks down.

It's so inspired! Look at him! Look at him go!

Thank you guys-guys-guys...

Hey, aren't you up next?

Oh no, I'm not playing tonight.

Why not?

I can't follow Ross! It'd be like those bicycle ridding chimps that followed The Beetles. No.

Phoebe, Ross sucks!

Phoebe, the place has emptied because of him.

Oh my God, he's not even appreciated in his own time. I would give anything to not be appreciated in my own time!

Okay. Umm, Phoebe, you suck too.

Yeah, Phoebe you're... awful!

You guys. You suck too.

Aww man! I can't believe I locked myself out again!

Hang on buddy!

Oh my God! What happened here? Did you do all this?

I sure did.

Why?

Well, I just thought it'd make me feel good to do something nice for my friend.

Well, you're amazing.

Oh no-no-no. This is amazing.

A TV as if it appears from nowhere! That's the dream! Man, how did you afford this stuff?

Well, y'know I'm 29. I mean who needs a savings account.

Oh, you are the best friends anyone has ever had.

Oh, I don't know.

Oh-no-no-no, you are! You do this, you give me the great advice, and hey listen, I was thinking about what you said yesterday about focusing on one woman, I'm gonna do that.

You mean with Casey.

No-no-no, I think I'm gonna see how things go with Kathy. She's pretty cool.

Or Casey.

No-no, Kathy.

Could be Casey.

No. No, Kathy.

Consider Casey.

Y'know what I think? I think somebody's got a little crush on Casey. How 'bout I fix you two up? What do you think?

That all the pieces of my life are falling right into place!

Hey!

Hey! You were really great! You were really, really great!

Oh, thanks, thanks. So Monica tells me that uh, you don't want to play anymore because me and y'know my talent. Is that true?

Well, kinda. Yeah. Yeah.

Pheebs...

Yeah, I-I can't-I mean y'know I was trying to be really y'know okay and upbeat about it, I just-I feel so dwarfed by your musical gift. I...

See but, Pheebs that-that is the exact opposite intent of my music. Y'know my music is-is meant to inspire, and if it bothers you this much, then I... I won't play anymore.

Oh no. No-no-no, don't do that! How could I live with myself if I knew I was depriving the world of your music.

Yeah, okay.

Hey Chandler! Saw the new furniture. Very nice.

Yeah! Joey has the best boyfriend ever!

I kissed Kathy.

What?

Are you serious?

Does Joey know?

No. Is there anyway, anyway you think he'll understand this?

You obviously haven't screwed over a lot of your friends. Which we all appreciate.

No the-the sad thing is, if you had told him how you felt before you kissed her, knowing Joey, he probably just would've just stepped aside.

Oh, don't say that! Don't say that. That's not true. Is it?

I think maybe, yeah.

He loves you.

Then why didn't you tell me to do that?!!

Well, I said-I said something to Phoebe.

Yeah! No, that's right. And I thought it was a really good idea.

I know, I remember that!

I remember you did.

God!! What am I gonna do?!

Well, Chandler, you're gonna have to tell him.

Why?! Why do I have to tell him?!

Because you do.

Yeah, I know.

Hey, would it be okay if I wrote a song about this.

Oh my God, he's lost it. He's totally lost it.

What?

Phoebe, his music could not get any worse. There are rats in the basement that are hanging themselves.

Thank you, thanks. Yeah, I lost it. Y'know, I'm not gonna play anymore, would you, can you finish my set?

After that? Yeah! No, I mean if I can help.

Yeah, like I could lose it.

What?

I played bad on purpose guys.

Okay, so you were trying to play bad this whole time.

Yeah-no, just that last song.
