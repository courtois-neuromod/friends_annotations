Man, I sure miss Julie.

Spanish midgets. Spanish midgets wrestling. Julie. Ok, yes, I see how you got there.

You ever figure out what that thing's for?

No, see, I'm trying this new screening thing. You know, I figure if I'm always answering the phone, people'll think I don't have a life. My god, Rodrigo never gets pinned.

Here comes the beep, you know what to do.

Hello, I'm looking for Bob. This is Jane. I don't know if you're still at this number, but I was just thinking about us, and how great it was, and, well, I know it's been three years, but, I was kinda hoping we could hook up again. I barely had t he nerve to make this call, so you know what I did?

What?

I got a little drunk...and naked.

Bob here.

What've you been up to?

Oh, you know, the usual, teaching aerobics, partying way too much. Oh, and in case you were wondering, those are my legs on the new James Bond poster.

Can you hold on a moment? I have another call. I love her.

I know.

I'm back.

So, are we gonna get together or what?

Um, absolutely. Uh, how 'bout tomorrow afternoon? Do you know uh, Central Perk in the Village, say, five-ish?

Great, I'll see you then.

Ok. Ok. Having a phone has finally paid off.

Even though you do do a good Bob impression, I'm thinkin' when she sees you tomorow, she's probably gonna realize, "hey, you're not Bob."

I'm hoping that when Bob doesn't show up, she will seek comfort in the open arms of the wry stranger at the next table.

Oh my god. You are pure evil.

Ok, pure evil, horny and alone. I've done this.

You know what? I'm not gonna be able to enjoy this.

Yeah, I know, it's my birthday. We all should be here.

So, let's go.

Well maybe, you know, maybe we should stay for one song.

Yeah, I mean, it would be rude to them for us to leave now.

You know, the guys are probably having a great time.

Come on you guys, one more time.

Ok. One.

Nooo.

That was amazing!

Excellent, that was excellent.

I can't believe the guys missed this.

What guys? Oh, yeah.

Excuse me, you're Monica Geller aren't you?

Do I know you?

You used to be my babysitter.

Oh my god, little Stevie Fisher? How've you been?

Good, good, I'm a lawyer now.

You can't be a lawyer. You're eight.

Listen, it was nice to see you. I gotta run backstage.

Uh, wait, backstage?

Oh, yeah, my firm represents the band.

Ross.

Chandler.

How are you? Look, you guys wanna meet the group? Come on. So, are you one of the ones who fooled around with my dad?
