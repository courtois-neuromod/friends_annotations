What you guys don't understand is, for us, kissing is as important as any part of it.

Yeah, right!.......Y'serious?

Oh, yeah!

Everything you need to know is in that first kiss.

Absolutely.

Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out.

Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket.

The problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know? I mean, we're in the car, we're fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake.

Yeah, well, word of advice: Bring back the comedian. Otherwise next time you're gonna find yourself sitting at home, listening to that album alone.

....Are we still talking about sex?

No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a little angry?

Well, she has issues.

Does she.

He's out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet!

Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, that glacier's getting kinda close.' See?

Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife?

No. No.

Yes, it is. Carol! Hi!

Okay, okay, yes, it is. How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age.

Hi.

So.

You look great. I, uh... I hate that.

Sorry. You look good too.

Ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... So what's new? Still, uh...

A lesbian?

Well... you never know. How's, um.. how's the family?

Marty's still totally paranoid. Oh, and, uh-

Why- why are you here, Carol?

I'm pregnant.

Pregnant?!

Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur.. thing.. anyway.

Hi.

Ross, you remember Susan.

How could I forget?

Ross.

Hello, Susan. Good shake. Good shake. So, uh, we're just waiting for...?

Dr. Oberman.

..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he-

She.

-she, of course, she- uh- familiar with our.. special situation?

Yes, and she's very supportive.

Okay, that's great. No, I'm- Oh.

Thanks.

Quack, quack..

Ross? That opens my cervix.

Barry?

C'mon in.

Are you sure?

Yeah! It's fine, it's fine. Robbie's gonna be here for hours.

Huh?!

So, how ya doin?

I'm- uh- I'm okay... You look great!

Yeah, well..

Dr. Farber, Jason Greenstein's gagging.

Be right there. Be back in a sec.

I dumped him.

Okay.

So, um- so how's this, uh, how's this gonna work? Y'know, with us? Y'know, when, like, important decisions have to be made?

Give me a 'for instance'.

Well, uh, uh, I don't know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the baby's name?

Marlon-

Marlon?!

-if it's a boy, Minnie if it's a girl.

...As in Mouse?

As in my grandmother.

Still, you- you say Minnie, you hear Mouse. Um, how about, um.. how about Julia?

Julia..

We agreed on Minnie.

'S'funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend the rest of our lives together. Things change, roll with the punches. I believe Julia's on the table..?

Sorry about that. So. What have you been up to?

Oh, not much. I-I got a job.

Oh, that's great.

Why are- why are you so tanned?

Oh, I, uh- I went to Aruba.

Oh no. You went on our honeymoon alone?

No. I went with, uh.. Now, this may hurt.

Me?!

No! I went with Mindy.

Mindy?! My maid of honour, Mindy?!

Yeah, well, uh, we're kind of a thing now.

Oh! Well, um.. You've got plugs!

Careful! They haven't quite taken yet.

And you've got lenses! But you hate sticking your finger in your eye!

Not for her. Listen, I really wanted to thank you.

Okay..

See, about a month ago, I wanted to hurt you. More than I've ever wanted to hurt anyone in my life. And I'm an orthodontist.

Wow.

You know, you were right? I mean, I thought we were happy. We weren't happy. But with Mindy, now I'm happy. Spit.

What?

Me.

Anyway, um, I guess this belongs to you. And thank you for giving it to me.

Well, thank you for giving it back.

Hello?!

Oh, please! What's wrong with Helen?

Helen Geller? I don't think so.

Hello? It's not gonna be Helen Geller.

Thank you!

No, I mean it's not Geller.

What, it's gonna be Helen Willick?

No, actually, um, we talked about Helen Willick-Bunch.

Well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title?

It's my baby too.

Oh, 's'funny, really? Um, I don't remember you making any sperm.

Yeah, and we all know what a challenge that is!

All right, you two, stop it!

No no no, she gets a credit, hey, I'm in there too.

Ross. You're not actually suggesting Helen Willick-Bunch-Geller? 'Cause I think that borders on child abuse.

Of course not, I'm... suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch.

Oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing? He knows no-one's gonna say all those names, so they'll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his way!

My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I can't do-

Knock knock!How are we today? Any nausea?

Yeah. Yeah. A little.

Well, I was just wondering about the mother-to-be, but.. thanks for sharing. Uh, lie back..

You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now.

Oh my God.

Look at that.

I know.

Well? Isn't that amazing?

What are we supposed to be seeing here?

I dunno, but.. I think it's about to attack the Enterprise.

You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it kinda looks like an old potato.

Then don't do that, alright?

Okay!

Monica. Whaddya think?

Mm-hmm.

Wh- are you welling up?

No.

You are, you're welling up.

Am not!

You're gonna be an aunt.

Oh shut up!

Hi, Mindy. Hi, it-it's Rachel. Yeah, I'm fine. I-I saw Barry today. Oh, yeah, yeah he-he told me. No, no, it's okay. I hope you two are very happy, I really do. Oh, oh, and Mind, y'know, if-if everything works out, and you guys end up getting married and having kids- and everything- I just hope they have his old hairline and your old nose. Okay, I know it was a cheap shot, but I feel so much better now.
