I'm supposed to attach a brackety thing to the side things, using a bunch of these little worm guys. I have no brackety thing, I see no whim guys whatsoever and- I cannot feel my legs.

I'm thinking we've got a bookcase here.

It's a beautiful thing.

What's this?

I would have to say that is an 'L'-shaped bracket.

Which goes where?

I have no idea.

Done with the bookcase!

All finished!

This was Carol's favorite beer. She always drank it out of the can, I should have known.

Hey-hey-hey-hey, if you're gonna start with that stuff we're outta here.

Yes, please don't spoil all this fun.

Ross, let me ask you a question. She got the furniture, the stereo, the good TV- what did you get?

You guys.

Oh, God.

You got screwed.

Oh my God!

Oh my God!

I know, I know, I'm such an idiot. I guess I should have caught on when she started going to the dentist four and five times a week. I mean, how clean can teeth get?

My brother's going through that right now, he's such a mess. How did you get through it?

Well, you might try accidentally breaking something valuable of hers, say her-

-leg?

That's one way! Me, I- I went for the watch.

You actually broke her watch? Wow! The worst thing I ever did was, I-I shredded by boyfriend's favorite bath towel.

Ooh, steer clear of you.

That's right.

I'm divorced! I'm only 26 and I'm divorced!

Shut up!

You must stop!

That only took me an hour.

Look, Ross, you gotta understand, between us we haven't had a relationship that has lasted longer than a Mento. You, however have had the love of a woman for four years. Four years of closeness and sharing at the end of which she ripped your heart out, and that is why we don't do it! I don't think that was my point!

You know what the scariest part is? What if there's only one woman for everybody, y'know? I mean what if you get one woman- and that's it? Unfortunately in my case, there was only one woman- for her...

What are you talking about? 'One woman'? That's like saying there's only one flavor of ice cream for you. Lemme tell you something, Ross. There's lots of flavors out there. There's Rocky Road, and Cookie Dough, and Bing! Cherry Vanilla. You could get 'em with Jimmies, or nuts, or whipped cream! This is the best thing that ever happened to you! You got married, you were, like, what, eight? Welcome back to the world! Grab a spoon!

I honestly don't know if I'm hungry or horny.

Stay out of my freezer!

Ever since she walked out on me, I, uh...

What?..... What, you wanna spell it out with noodles?

No, it's, it's more of a fifth date kinda revelation.

Oh, so there is gonna be a fifth date?

Isn't there?

Yeah... yeah, I think there is. -What were you gonna say?

Well, ever-ev-... ever since she left me, um, I haven't been able to, uh, perform. ...Sexually.

Oh God, oh God, I am sorry... I am so sorry...

It's okay...

I know being spit on is probably not what you need right now. Um... how long?

Two years.

Wow! I'm-I'm-I'm glad you smashed her watch!

So you still think you, um... might want that fifth date?

...Yeah. Yeah, I do.

Grab a spoon. Do you know how long it's been since I've grabbed a spoon? Do the words 'Billy, don't be a hero' mean anything to you?

Great story! But, I uh, I gotta go, I got a date with Andrea--Angela--Andrea... Oh man,

Angela's the screamer, Andrea has cats.

Right. Thanks. It's June. I'm outta here.

Y'know, here's the thing. Even if I could get it together enough to- to ask a woman out,... who am I gonna ask?

Hey, Monica!

Hey Frannie, welcome back! How was Florida?

You had sex, didn't you?

How do you do that?

Oh, I hate you, I'm pushing my Aunt Roz through Parrot Jungle and you're having sex! So? Who?

You know Paul?

Paul the Wine Guy? Oh yeah, I know Paul.

You mean you know Paul like I know Paul?

Are you kidding? I take credit for Paul. Y'know before me, there was no snap in his turtle for two years.

Of course it was a line!

Why?! Why? Why, why would anybody do something like that?

I assume we're looking for an answer more sophisticated than 'to get you into bed'.

I hate men! I hate men!

Oh no, don't hate, you don't want to put that out into the universe.

Is it me? Is it like I have some sort of beacon that only dogs and men with severe emotional problems can hear?

All right, c'mere, gimme your feet.

I just thought he was nice, y'know?

I can't believe you didn't know it was a line!

Guess what?

You got a job?

Are you kidding? I'm trained for nothing! I was laughed out of twelve interviews today.

And yet you're surprisingly upbeat.

You would be too if you found John and David boots on sale, fifty percent off!

Oh, how well you know me...

They're my new 'I don't need a job, I don't need my parents, I've got great boots' boots!

How'd you pay for them?

Uh, credit card.

And who pays for that?

Um... my... father.

I can't believe what I'm hearing here.

I can't believe what I'm hearing here...

What? I-I said you had a-

What I said you had...

Would you stop?

Oh, was I doing it again?

Yes!

I said that you had a nice butt, it's just not a great butt.

Oh, you wouldn't know a great butt if it came up and bit ya.

There's an image.

Would anybody like more coffee?

Did you make it, or are you just serving it?

I'm just serving it.

Yeah. Yeah, I'll have a cup of coffee.

Kids, new dream... I'm in Las Vegas.

Ahh, miss? More coffee?

Ugh. Excuse me, could you give this to that guy over there? Go ahead. Thank you. Sorry. Okay, Las Vegas.

Okay, so, I'm in Las Vegas... I'm Liza Minelli-
