Ok. Here's his diaper bag, and his uh, Mr. Winky, and uh...oh, him. Hi!

So how did everything go?

Oh, great. Great. There was a projectile, uh, throwing up incident, but he started it.

Well, we've gotta go.

Ok.

Oh, right. Um, I've got some news. It's about us.

Oh, you and me?

Uh, no, Susan and me.

The other us.

Ok.

We're uh, we're getting married.

As in, "I now pronounce you wife and wife" married?

Anyway, we'd like you to come, but we totally understand if you don't want to.

Why wouldn't I want to come? I had fun at the first wedding.

Look I just thought that...

No no no, I mean, hey, why shouldn't I be happy for you? What would it say about me if I couldn't revel in your joy? I'm revelling baby, believe me!

Is your finger caught in that chair?

Mmm hmmm.

Want us to go?

Uh-huh.

That is so good! Do it again!

All right, all right. "Damnit Braverman, it's right there on the chart!"

That's great. All right, I gotta get to work, I got a big dinosaur bone to inspect.

No no, that's me.

Oh, yeah.

Oh, hello.

Oh, thanks. I couldn't uh...

Is everything ok?

Um, no, huh-uh. One of my clients died on the massage table today.

Oh my god.

That's a little more relaxed than you want them to get.

Yeah, um, she was 82 years old. Her name was um, Mrs. Adelman.

Oh, honey.

Yeah, it's just so strange. I mean, she probably woke up today and thought, "ok, I'll have some breakfast, and then I'll take a little walk, and then I'll have my massage." Little did she know God was thinking, "Ok, but that's it." Oh, but the weirdest thing was, ok, I was cleansing her aura when she died, and when the spirit left her body, I don't think it went very far.

What do you mean?

I think it went into me.

Hi.

How's it going?

It's goin' great. Right on schedule. Got my little happy helpers.

Fine, whatever.

What's the matter?

Nothing. Ok, everything. I think we're calling off the wedding.

What?

You're still gonna pay me, right? Or something a little less selfish.

Carol, what's the matter? What happened?

My parents called this afternoon to say they weren't coming.

Oh my god.

I mean, I knew they were having trouble with this whole thing, but they're my parents. They're supposed to give me away and everything.

It's ok. I'm sorry.

And then Susan and I got in this big fight because I said maybe we should call off the wedding, and she said we weren't doing it for them, we were doing it for us, and if I couldn't see that, then maybe we should call off the wedding. I don't know what to do.

I uh can't believe I'm gonna say this, but I think Susan's right.

You do?

Look, do you love her? And you don't have to be too emphatic about this.

Of course I do.

Well then that's it. And if George and Adelaide can't accept that, then the hell with them. Look, if my parents didn't want me to marry you, no way that would have stopped me. Look, this is your wedding. Do it.

You're right. Of course you're right.

So we're back on?

We're back on.

You heard the woman. Peel, chop, devil! I can't believe I lost 2 minutes.

It just seems so futile, you know ? All these women, and nothing. I feel like Superman without my powers, you know? I have the cape, and yet I cannot fly.

Well now you understand how I feel every single day, ok? The world is my lesbian wedding.

Butterscotch? No one? All right, you'll be sorry later.

Thank you.

Any time.

Ross.

You know, nothing makes God happier than when two people, any two people, come together in love. Friends, family, we're gathered here today to join Carol and Susan in holy matrimony.

Oh my god. Now I've seen everything! Whoa, she's gone. She's gone. She's gone! Go ahead, get married. Go, go.

Would you look at them?

Yeah, can't help but.

How's that pig-in-the-blanket workin' out for you? I wrapped those bad boys.

I miss Rose.

Oh, yeah?

I know it's kind of weird, but I mean, she was a big part of my life there, you know, and now I just feel kind of alone.

You know, I uh, I couldn't help but overhear what you just said, and I think it's time for you to forget about Rose, move on with your life...how 'bout we go get you a drink?

Ok, that's so nice.

I shouldn't even bother coming up with a line, right?

Hey, Mom? Having fun?

Oh, am I! I just danced with a wonderfully large woman. And three other girls made eyes at me over the buffet. Oh, I'm not saying it's something I wanna pursue, but it's nice to know I have options.

There's more alcohol, right?

How you doin'?

Ok.

You did a good thing today.

Yeah.

You wanna dance?

No, that's fine.

Come on. I'll let you lead.

Ok.

All right look. Penis schmenis. We're all people.

Ok, which one of us do you think is gonna be the first one to get married?

Well, Mon, I was married.

Yeah, me, too, technically.

I had a wedding.

All right, just trying to start an interesting discussion.

I got one. Which one of us do you think will be the last to get married?

Isn't Ben in this?

Oh, yeah!
