What is it hon?

I-I can't find anything that I want to eat! Everything I eat makes me nauseous! I'm telling you, being pregnant is no piece of cake-ooh! Cake! No.

Aww, honey I'm sorry.

God! Ooh! What is that smell? It's coming from the bathroom. Ooh!

Wow! Pregnancy does give you some weird cravings.

Yeah?

It's me. It's Phoebe. Listen there's something in here I want to eat, what-what smells so good?

Is it the shampoo? It's guava.

No!

Oh! Wait-wait! Is it my bologna sandwich?

Yes. Yes. Yes. I can't believe it! The baby wants bologna! Maybe he wants me to eat meat? I can't eat meat!

Oh, wait-wait! Maybe it's a pickle?!

Okay!

Oh, here's that trench-coat that you wanted.

Oh great! Wow! Yeah, it's comfortable.

Yeah?

Man, I could really flash somebody in this thing.

Oh no-no, no-no, they don't want you to put your hands in the pockets until you are out of the store.

Why not?!

Well, that's because of a lot of...

Y'know, they ruin it for everybody.

I know!

Y'know, I wore that cashmere sweater on a date last night.

Oh?

Yeah, it was my first date since the uh, since the divorce.

Well, congratulations, so do you love her?

No, no, no, she's nice but, y'know, it just it made me realize that I'm just not, I'm just not ready to be dating, y'know?

Huh. Well, uh, that's uh, that's interesting.

Hey-whoa-hey-hey, what was that?

Oh, it's just an anti-theft device.

Then uh, what's-what's this?

You need that, you need that too 'cause obviously, a thief could just tear this up.

Oooh, what you got there?

Pastrami.

Oh-ho-ho, yeah! Hey! Y'know what goes good with that?

Hm-mm, corn beef.

Ooh, I was gonna say bologna, but that's much better. How about a little of that smoked turkey?

Okay.

Oh mama! Uh when-when is the baby due?

Six months.

Ugh. Now if a cow should die of natural causes, I can have one of those right?

Not if I get there first.
