Do you think they have yesterday's daily news?

Why?

Just wanna check my horoscope, see if it was right.

Oh my God. Phoebe. Don't look now, but behind us is a guy who has the potential to break our hearts and plunge us into a pit of depression.

Where? Ooh, come to Momma.

He's coming. Be cool, be cool, be cool.

Nice hat.

Thanks.

We should do something. Whistle.

We are not going to whistle.

Come on, do it.

No!

Do it!

No!

Do it do it do it!

Woo-woo!

I can't believe you did that!

Why did I 'woo-hoo'? I mean, what was I hoping would happen? That-that he'd turn round and say 'I love that sound, I must have you now'?

I just wish there was something we could do. Hello. Hello, Coma Guy. GET UP, YOU GIRL SCOUT! UP! UP! UP!

Phoebe, what are you doing?

Maybe nobody's tried this.

I wish we at least knew his name... Look at that face. I mean, even sleeping, he looks smart. I bet he's a lawyer.

Yeah, but did you see the dents in his knuckles? That means he's artistic.

Okay, he's a lawyer, who teaches sculpting on the side. And- he can dance!

Oh! And, he's the kinda guy who, when you're talking, he's listening, y'know, and not saying 'Yeah, I understand' but really wondering what you look like naked.

I wish all guys could be like him.

I know.

Let's see. Congress is debating a new deficit reduction bill... the mayor wants to raise subway fares again... the high today was forty-five... and- oh, teams played sports.

What about Glen? He could be a Glen.

Nah... not-not special enough.

Ooh! How about Agamemnon?

Waaay too special.

Hi.

Hi.

What are you doing here?

Nothing, I just thought I'd stop by.. y'know, after the uh... that I.. y'know, so what are you doing here?

I'm not really here. Just thought I'd drop these off...on the way.. my way... Do you come here a lot? Without me?

No. No! No! ...So, um, do you think he's doing any better than he was this morning?

How would I know? I-I wasn't here.

Really? Not even to, um, change his PAJAMAS?!

Oh my God.

You're my friend. I-I had to tell you.

I can't believe it. Paolo kissed my mom?

Yeah, um, I don't know if you noticed, but he had a lot to drink, and you know how he gets when he's drun..uh... I can't do this, I did it, it was me, I'm sorry, I kissed your mom.

What?

I was really upset about Rachel and Paolo, and I think I had too much tequila, and Nora- um, Mrs. Mom- your Bing- was just being nice, y'know, and- But nothing happened, nothing- Ask Joey, Joey, uh, came in-

You knew about this?

Uh... y'know, knowledge is a tricky thing.

I spent the entire day with you, why didn't you tell me?!

Hey, hey, hey, you're lucky I caught them when I did, or else who knows what woulda happened.

Thanks, man, big help.

I can't believe this! What the hell were you thinking?

I wasn't- I mean, I-

Y'know, of all my friends, no-one knows the crap I go through with my mom more than you.

I know-

I can't believe you did this.

Chandler-

Me neither, y'know what-

I'm still mad at you for not telling me.

What are you mad at me for?!

Chandler-

You gotta let me slam the door!

Chandler, I didn't kiss her, he did! See what happens when you break the code?

Joey-

Ah! Huh?

Okay. Now this is just the first chapter, and I want your absolute honest opinion. Oh, oh, and on page two, he's not 'reaching for her heaving beasts'.

What's a 'niffle'?

You usually find them on the 'heaving beasts'.

Alright, alright, so I'm not a great typist...

Wait, did you get to the part about his 'huge throbbing pens'? Tell ya, you don't wanna be around when he starts writing with those!

Alright, that's it! Give it back! That's it!

Nooo!
