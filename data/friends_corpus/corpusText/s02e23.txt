Honey, you made the bed again. I told you, you don't have to do that. This isn't camp.

Ooh, then I guess the panty raid last night was totally uncalled for. Ok, I am going to take a shower and today I will be singing Jim Crochee's Leroy Brown.

Monica... Hey Mon, I have a question. Is Leroy the baddest man in the whole damn town or the fattest man in the whole damn town?

Baddest. Otherwise the song would be Fat Fat Leroy Brown.

What're you doing?

Just waiting for you sweetie.

Are you remaking the bed?

I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You know what, the way you did it was just fine.

Then, you're redoing it because...

If I tell you, you'll think I'm crazy.

You're pretty much running that risk either way.

Ok, you see, the tag shouldn't be at the top left corner, it should be at the bottom right corner.

Oh, well that's not so crazy.

I'm just easing you in.

Oh, alright.

Alright, you see these little flower blossoms? They should be facing up, not down, because, well, the head of the bed is where the sun would be. You don't love me any more do you.

Actually, if it's possible, I love you more.

Really? Wow, well then come on, I wanna show you how to fold the toilet paper into a point.

Hey, look Joey, I'm just saying if you need something to hold you over, I can get you a job right here as an entry level processor.

But don't you need experience for a job like that?

It's not that hard to learn. And as for people realizing you have no idea what you're doing, hey, you're an actor. Act like a processor, people will think you're a processor.

Hey Chandler, here's this morning's projections.

Hey thanks. Scott Alexander, Joey Tribbianni. Joey is a uh, fellow processor.

No kidding.

Oh yeah yeah. I process. People want the processing, I'm the one they call.

Where do you work?

Uhh, well, right now I'm in between things. You know how it is. One day you're processing, the next day you're not so much... processing any more.

I was just telling Joey about the opening in Fleischman's group.

Fleischman's group. Whatever you do, don't touch his sandwiches. Ha-ha-ha...

Ha-ha. Are all you processors dorks?

Oh, this lipstick looks just great on you.

You look fabulous honey, you really do.

Yeah? Are you sure, really.

You see, you look beautiful. For god sakes, dim the lights.

I, I, I'm hideous.

It's gonna be ok. Ryan's been under water. He's just gonna be so glad that you don't have barnicles on your butt.

Come in.

Hey baby, I'm back...

Hey Ryan, what's up?

What's goin' on?

Well, no no, you have to stay back. I, I have the pox.

Chicken or small?

Chicken. Which is so ironic considering I'm a vegetarian.

Why aren't you at home in bed?

'Cause my, my grandmother's never had chicken pox. Please, please tell me you have, 'cause oh my God, I forgot how cute you are.

I'm sorry, I never had 'em.

Ohh, ohh.

If I had one wish, it would be to build a time machine, go back to when I was 7, when Jimmy Hauser had the chicken pox. I would grab that kid and rub him all over my face.

Yeah, or you know, you could just wish that I didn't have them now.

Can I please see your face?

Nope. You don't want to see a face covered with pox.

Your face could be covered with lochs, I wouldn't care.

And you hate fish. Oh. That's so sweet, alright. Ok, alright, you can see. This is me... Oh, I am scary.

Sorry, the lightning. Lightning was an unfortunate incidence. You look lovely, lovely.

I hate this. 'Cause I tell you, I had the most amazing two weeks planned for us, and almost everything I had in mind, we had to be a lot closer than this.

Phoebe, I have spent the last eight months in a steel tube with men, thinking about this moment. I am not gonna let a bunch of itchy spots stand between us.

Ok, this is the most romantic disease I've ever had.

Hey.

Hey, how's the first day goin'?

Pretty good. It's like you said. It's mostly just putting numbers from one column into another column.

Well there you go.

Hey and everbody is so nice. I just had a good talk with that lady with the red hair, Jeannie.

Jeannie, the head of east coast operations Jeannie?

Yeah, turns out our kids go to the same school. Small world huh?

Weird world. Your kids?

I figure my character has kids.

Ya know there isn't a part of that sentence I don't need explained.

Well, see when you're acting you need to think about stuff like that. My character, Joseph the processor guy, has two little girls, Ashley and Brittany. Ashley copies everything Brittany does.

Well, invisible kids can be that way sometimes.

Yeah. Joseph and his wife, Karen, are thinking of having a third kid... Ya know what? Just did.

Really? Wow. That's some pretty powerful imaginary sperm you must have there.

You know what makes the itching even worse?

That you don't stop talking about it.

Fine.

Let's just play, ok. Good, ok. Here we go, double sixes, here we go... Here we go, come to mama, just getting ready to roll the dice...

What're you doing? Are you scratching?

No. This is what I do for luck, ok.

You're scratching. Give me the dice.

No.

Give me the dice.

No. Here. There. Ooh, double sixes.

We can't scratch. You know we can't, we'll scar.

Uhh, I can't stop thinking about it. It's just so hard. I just wanna grab all these houses and rub 'em all over my body.

No.

Give it.

No.

Yeah, come on. You know you want it, you know you want it too, come on. Let's just be bad, it'll feel so good.

Oh God help me.

Now do me, do my back. Oh come on, harder.

Oh, stop that, stop that right now.

You know, I might have expected this of you Phoebe, but Ryan, you're a military man.

You and Milton have to join us on the boat. Karen'll pack a lunch, you'll bring the kids, we'll make a day of it.

Oh, that sounds lovely. We're gonna have to set that up. Oh, I better get back. Hope the baby feels better.

Oh, thanks, thanks. Bye bye Jeannie.

Bye bye Joey.

What a phony.

Well, I'm sure you'll teach her a lesson when she steps off the dock onto nothing. Hey Mr. Douglas.

Sir.

Uh, listen Bing, I received your memo. So, we're not gonna receive the systems report until next Friday?

Well the people in my group wanna spend the holiday weekend with their families.

I have a family, I'm gonna be here.

Yeah Bing, what's that about?

It's about cutting my people a little slack, ya know, for morale. Look, if you wanna see some rough numbers, I can get them to you by Wednesday.

Rough numbers?

This company was not built on rough numbers. Am I right Mr. Douglas.

Have the final numbers on my desk by Tuesday.

Uh, if you say so sir.

Joseph's good, isn't he?

Well, I'm going to kill you.

Hey, hey, I just figure Joseph's the kinda guy that likes to mix it up. Ya know, get in there, ruffle some feathers.

Why?

Look, I'm sorry but that's what Joseph does, ok. If you try to pull somethin', he'll call you on it. 'What're you tryin' to pull,' he'll say.

Hey. Mr. Douglas is looking for you.

Why? Wh- wh- why is Mr. Douglas looking for me?

'Cause he has a strong suspicion that you dropped the ball on the Lender project.

Wha- wh- why, why, why does he suspect that?

Becasue at first he thought it was Joseph. But after he asked Joseph about it, turns out it was you. Anyway, I just thought you should know.

Alright, that's it. Look Joey, I'm sorry, I realize this is the role of a lifetime for ya, and if I could just fire Joseph, I would, but unfortunately that's not possible so I'm gonna have to let both of you go.

What're you talking about, everybody loves Joseph.

I don't, I hate Joseph, ok. I think he's a brown-nosing suck up.

Oh yeah. Well you can't fire Joseph. You know why, 'cause he's not in your department.

Alright, ok, alright. So I can't fire Joseph but uh, I can sleep with his wife.

Karen.

Yeah, Karen. I'm thinking about having an affair with her. Oh, you know what? I just did.

Ahh. What the hell are you doing to me man.

Oh well it's not me, it's my character, Chandy. Yeah the rogue processor who seduces his co-worker's wives for sport and then laughs about it the next day at the water cooler. In fact, I have her panties right there in my drawer.

Really?

No freakshow, she's fictional.

Take it easy. If it means that much to you, I'll uh, I'll go find something else.

Thank you.

It's just that, I, I'm gonna miss Joseph. I liked him. His wife, she was hot.

Can I please take these off? I swear I won't scratch.

No sorry hon, Monica's orders.

Well that wasn't easy.

Ok, dinner's on.

And there's a peach cobbler warming in the oven so the plate's gonna be hot but that shouldn't be a problem for you.

Alright you kids, bye now.

Bye.

Oh look, a low budget puppet show.

It's such a shame you can't see which finger I'm holding up.

Wine?

Please.

Oh, I spilled some.

I got it.

I must tell you, you look beautiful tonight.

What?

Sorry. You look beautiful.

Oh.

You know what, that's it, that's it.

Monica, wake up. Monica.

What's up?

I thought of a thing.

Yeah?

Yeah. I have to sleep, have to, on this side of the bed.

No honey. You have to sleep on this side of the bed because I have to sleep on this side of the bed.

Or so I would have you believe.

No. Big deal, so you have a side of the bed, everybody has a side of the bed.

Hey come on, you haven't heard my reason yet.

Alright, go on.

Ok, I have to sleep on the west side because I grew up in California and otherwise the ocean would be on the wrong side.

Oh my God, you're a freak.

Yeah. How 'bout that.

So uh, Ryan, were you shipping off to?

I really can't say.

So do you have like any nuclear weapons on board?

I can't say.

Well do you get to look through one of those like, those periscope thingys.

I'm sorry, but I can't say.

Wow, it, it's neat learning about submarines.

I better get out of here, I'm gonna miss my flight.

Ok, I'll walk you out.

Bye Ryan.

Pleasure.

It was nice to meet you.

Take care.

So do you uh, think we can get you one of those uh, uniform things?

You like that do ya?

Oh yeah.

I'll make some calls.

Ok.

Can you believe how we spent our two weeks together?

I know. We didn't do any of the romantic things I had planned, like having a picnic at Central Park and ya know, coffee at Central Perk. Oh I just got that.

Taxi.

Bye you.

Oh I'm sorry, we're clo-... Hey sailor.

Is this what you had in mind?

I'll say.

I'm shipping out tomorrow.

Well then uh, we better make this night count. Oh wait, I forgot to turn off the cappucino machine. Anchors away. Oh no no, my purse, my purse, my purse, my purse, my purse, my pu rse. Oh, you know what. I forgot to turn off the bathroom light.

Alright you know, why don't I just meet you upstairs.
