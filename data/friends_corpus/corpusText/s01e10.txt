Guys? There's a somebody I'd like you to meet.

Oooh!

W-wait. What is that?

'That' would be Marcel. You wanna say hi?

No, no, I don't.

Oh, he is precious! Where did you get him?

My friend Bethel rescued him from some lab.

That is so cruel! Why? Why would a parent name their child Bethel?

Hey, that monkey's got a Ross on its ass!

Ross, is he gonna live with you, like, in your apartment?

Yeah. I mean, it's been kinda quiet since Carol left, so...

Why don't you just get a roommate?

Nah, I dunno... I think you reach a certain age, having a roommate is kinda pathe- ....sorry, that's, that's 'pathet', which is Sanskrit for 'really cool way to live'.

...But, you can't actually test this theory, because today's particle accelerators are nowhere near powerful enough to simulate these conditions.

Okay, alright, I have a question, then.

Yuh.

Um, were you planning on kissing me ever?

Uh, that's definitely a, uh, valid question. And, uh, the answer would be yes. Yes I was. But, see, I wanted it to be this phenomenal kiss that happened at this phenomenal moment, because, well, 'cause it's you.

Sure.

Right. But, see, the longer I waited, the more phenomenal the kiss had to be, and now we've reached a place where it's just gotta be one of those things where I just like... sweep everything off the table and throw you down on it. And, uh, I'm not really a, uh, sweeping sorta fella.

Oh, David, I, I think you are a sweeping sorta fella. I mean, you're a sweeper! ...trapped inside a physicist's body.

Rrrreally.

Oh, yeah, oh, I'm sure of it. You should just do it, just sweep and throw me.

...Now? Now?

Oh yeah, right now.

Okay, okay, okay. Y'know what, this was just really expensive. And I'll take- this was a gift.

Okay, now you're just kinda tidying.

Okay, what the hell, what the hell. You want me to actually throw you or you-you wanna just hop?

I can hop.

Hello?

Hey!

Hi.

Hi! What-what're you doing here?

Um, well, Max told me about Minsk, so congratulations! This is so exciting!

It'd be even more exciting if we were going.

Oh, you're not going? Oh, why?

Tell her, David. 'I don't wanna go to Minsk and work with Lifson and Yamaguchi and Flench, on nonononononono. I wanna stay here and make out with my girlfriend!!'

Thank you, Max. Thank you.

So-so you're really not going?

I don't know. I don't know what I'm gonna do. I just- you decide.

Oh don't do that.

Please.

Oh no no.

No, but I'm asking-

Oh, but I can't do that-

No, but I can't-

It's your thing, and-

-make the decision-

Okay, um, stay.

Stay.

Stay.

Getting so good at that!

It was Max's stuff.
