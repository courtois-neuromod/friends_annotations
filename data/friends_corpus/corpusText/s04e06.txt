So, thank you for the delicious dinner.

You're welcome for a delicious dinner.

Hey what are you guys looking at?

Ross and the most beautiful girl in the world.

Yeah, come to papa.

I know!

Probably the only time I'll ever say this, but did you see the ass on her?

Where did you, when did you, how did you... How did you get a girl like that?

Yeah, so what is she, like a... like a spokesmodel, or an aerobics instructor, what?

Actually she's a paleontology doctoral candidate, specializing in the centazoic era.

Okay, but that's, like, the easiest era.

I've seen her at work, but I always figured, ah-huh? But, uh, I made her dinner. We had a great time. And we're going out again tomorrow.

Well maybe she and her friends are just having a contest to see who can bring home the biggest geek.

Fine by me; hope she wins.

Huh...

Um, would you like to come in?

Did homo-erectus hunt with wooden tools?

According to recent findings!

Here Mitzi! Here Mitzi!

Mitzi is.....

My hamster. I hope she's okay, I haven't seen her in a while. Have a seat.

Uh... Oh hey, do you, uh ...do you have any, um, Cinnamon Fruit Toasties?

What?

Well, I do! Why don't we go back to my place, light a couple of candles, break open a box of Cinnamon Fruit Toasties, uh...

I'd rather not.

Oh, yeah, why not?

Okay, um, don't take this the wrong way, but your place kinda has a weird smell.

Oh, is everything in the car?

Yes. Did you settle the bill?

No. I hate this part.

Oh, look what we almost left.

No, that's not mine.

Oh, all right. Oh! Look what we almost took!

Excuse me, Mrs. Burkart? Well, we're all cleaned up in the kitchen.

Oh, good. Thank you.

Um, and, well there's the.. the the small matter of...

Dear?

Just the matter of ...payment?

Jack used to handle the finances!

But Mon, you have to get our money!

Oh, Phoebe, she couldn't stop crying! With those thick glasses, her tears looked giant.

I know, it's tough. You know what the first thing I did after my mother's funeral was?

What?

Pay the caterer! Look, I've had a lot of jobs, okay, and there are some people who just always try to get out of paying. It's either, you know, "that massage wasn't long enough, or, "I don't recognize any of those songs," or, you know, "these sombreros aren't big enough. Bad little white girl!"

Okay. So what do you.... you think she's faking?

Well, it seems like there weren't any tears 'til you showed her the bill.

Phoebe, she sounded pretty upset to me.

You're a grand ol' flag, you're a high-flying flag, and forever in peace may you wave....

She seems fine now.

...emblem of the land I love. The home of....

So, you just left? Her place was really that bad?

You know how you throw your jacket on a chair at the end of the day?

Yeah.

Well, like that, only instead of a chair, it's a pile of garbage. And instead of a jacket, it's a pile of garbage. And instead of the end of the day, it's the end of time, and garbage is all that has survived! Here.

Wow. Thanks. So, uh, what happened?

What do you mean? Nothing happened! I had to get out of there.

All right, so... next time, you take her to your place.

No, I tried that. She says it has a weird smell.

What kind of smell?

I don't know. Soap?

All right, listen, Ross... you like this girl, right?

Yeah.

You wanna see her again, right?

Yeah.

So you're gonna have to do it in the mess!

Yeah, okay you're right.

Yeah.

I mean, uh, who... who cares about a little sloppiness?

Yeah!

It's, uh... it's endearing, really.

All right! Now you go get that beautiful pig! Oink!

Okay, all right. I just spent the entire afternoon looking for a present for Kathy that would be better than the rabbit.

Any luck?

Oh, yeah. Yeah, I found this great place called "Invisible things for Kathy." Can you give me a hand with all this stuff?

All right, look. Why don't you just return the book, let Joey give her the clock pen, and you give her something worse than that. Like... a regular pen.

She's really going to love this, you know? The bottom line is I want her to have it, even if I don't get to be the one who gives it to her.

Aw, honey, that's so sweet.

Yeah? You don't think it's just pathetic?

Oh! Pathetic!

Hey! I'm meeting Kathy in ten minutes! I've been looking all over for you!

Where?

Our place, the hall! I...

I got something for her. It's a book!

A book? Is it like a book that's also a safe?

No, it's a book that's just a book, okay? It's an early edition of the Velveteen Rabbit. It was her favorite book as a kid. So, uh, just... let me know if she likes it, okay?

You got it. Thanks man. Thanks for doing this, I owe you one. Oh, hey! There wasn't any change from that twenty, was there?

No, it came out to an even twenty.

Wow. That's almost as much as a new book.

Jeepers, creepers, where'd you get those peepers? Jeepers, creepers, where'd you get those eyes?

You didn't get the money, did you?

Maybe I can try at intermission? Phoebe, come on... you know what? Let's just go!

No! Hey, we're not leaving until we get paid! I don't know who she thinks she is! Enough is enough! Hey, widow?

Come on along and listen to...

Okay, Widow!

...the lullabye of...

Excuse me. Excuse me! Thanks. Um, clearly this is a very, very hard time for you. Um, but, um, we provided a service, and we deserve to be paid because you ate that service, and, um, we are not leaving here until we're paid every penny. 'Cause you know what, lady? We're part time caterers, and we have no place else to go.

All right. I'll get my bag.

Good.

I'm gonna leave some cards here. Please think of us for you next event.

So you want to come inside?

Yes. Yes I do.

I'll be right back. Make yourself comfortable.

Guess who?

Department of Sanitation?

It's me!

Oh! Ah. Aw!

What?

Ah, Cheryl!

Oh, Ross!

Wait! No! No! It's my hamster! It's Mitzi!

Oh my god! I'm so sorry, Cheryl. I must have freaked out.

Oh, thank god, it's not Mitzi. It's just a rat.

I did it! Oh! I finished it! I did it all by myself! And there's nobody to hug!

Move!

Hey! Hey, you guys, I finished the crossword all by myself! Hug me!

Uh... yay!

Thanks!

Oh, that's great! Congratulations!

Thank you! Hey, how'd the catering go?

Oh, it was great! The widow wouldn't pay, so Phoebe yelled at her 'til she did.

Yeah. I'm a hard ass.

And I'm a wuss. And we should be partners.

Yeah. Hard Ass and Wuss. We could fight crime!

Wait a minute, Phoebe! We should be partners. We should be catering partners. I mean, think about it! You're not working right now, and we have such a great time together!

Okay!

I can cook and you can take care of the money.

Yeah. Oh! It'll be like I have a wife in the fifties!

Aah!
